    <h2>1030 - Commendations and Awards</h2>
    <h3>1030.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>Special recognition may be in order whenever an employee performs his/her duties in an exemplary manner. Citizens may at times perform a meritorious act that deserves recognition. This policy provides general guidelines for the commending of exceptional
        employee performance or meritorious acts by citizens.</p>

    <h3>1030.2 WHO MAY MAKE COMMENDATIONS</h3>
    <p>A recommendation for a commendation or award can be made by any sworn or non-sworn Metro Transit Police Department member. The recommendation shall be completed on a Metro Transit Police Department Awards Recommendation Form. A separate form must
        be completed for each individual recommended. The completed form and supporting documentation shall be forwarded to the Awards Committee Chairperson. Only those recommendations received on the approved form shall be considered by the Metro Transit
        Police Department Awards Committee.</p>
    <p>A recommendation made by a non-Metro Transit Police Department member will be accepted by the Awards Committee without completion of the approved form. The recommendation, along with any supporting documentation, shall be forwarded to the Awards Committee
        Chairperson for review and/or consideration.</p>

    <h3>1030.3 AWARDS COMMITTEE</h3>
    <p>The Awards Committee shall be comprised of members of the Metro Transit Police Department and will represent a cross section of the organization. The Committee shall consist of at least five members and not more than eight. The Committee shall be
        composed of no more than three supervisors (Sergeant and above) and shall include at least two officers. Additional members may be added at the direction of the Chief of Police or Awards Committee Chairperson.</p>
    <p>The Awards Committee Chairperson shall be appointed by the Chief of Police. The Chairperson shall serve a maximum of five consecutive years. The Chairperson may appoint a Co-Chairperson as needed.</p>
    <p>Awards Committee Members shall be appointed by the Chairperson. A member shall serve a minimum two year term and shall not serve more than five consecutive years. The Chairperson shall be responsible for adhering to this requirement and filling member
        positions as needed. This committee will meet quarterly or as determined by the Awards Committee Chairperson.</p>
    <h4>1030.3.1 AWARDS COMMITTEE VOTING REQUIREMENTS</h4>
    <p>An Awards Committee quorum shall consist of four members and must include the Chairperson or Co-Chairperson as appointed by the Chairperson.</p>
    <p>The Medal of Honor and the Medal of Valor requires a unanimous vote of the Awards Committee. All other awards require a majority vote of the Awards Committee. A member of the Awards Committee nominated for an award cannot vote on their nomination.</p>
    <p>If the Awards Committee determines the actions as recommended do not meet the criteria for the recommended award, the committee Chairperson may consider a different award. The Awards Committee will then vote on the amended award recommendation.</p>
