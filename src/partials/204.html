    <h2>204 - Interim Directive and Special Orders</h2>
    <h3>204.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>Interim Directives and Special Orders establish an interdepartmental communication that may be used by the Chief of Police to make immediate changes to policy and procedure consistent with the current Memorandum of Understanding or other collective bargaining agreement. Interim Directives will immediately modify or change and supersede sections of this manual to which they pertain.</p>
    <h4>204.1.1 INTERIM DIRECTIVES PROTOCOL</h4>
    <p>Interim Directives will be incorporated into the manual as required upon approval of staff. Interim Directives will modify existing policies or create a new policy as appropriate and will be rescinded upon incorporation into the manual.</p>
    <p>All existing Interim Directives have now been incorporated in the updated Policy Manual as of the below revision date.</p>
    <p>Any Interim Directives issued after publication of the manual shall be numbered consecutively starting with the last two digits of the year, followed by the number “01.” For example, 10-01 signifies the first Interim Directive for the year 2010.</p>
    <h4>204.1.2 SPECIAL ORDERS PROTOCOL</h4>
    <p>Special Orders establish a temporary policy or procedure on a given subject for a specific length of time. Special Orders are issued to the organization as a whole, to a division, to a unit or to an individual thereof and are temporary in nature. Special Orders become inoperative with the passing of the incident or situation that caused the order's issuance.</p>
