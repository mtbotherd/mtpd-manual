        recognition and providing analysis of data from field interrogations and arrests. Crime analysis can be useful to the Department's long-range planning efforts by providing estimates of future crime trends and assisting in the identification of
        enforcement priorities.</p>

    <h3>800.2 DATA SOURCES</h3>

        <li>Department of Public Safety - Crime Records Service</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>800.3 CRIME ANALYSIS FACTORS</h3>

    <h3>800.4 CRIME ANALYSIS DISSEMINATION</h3>
    <p>For a crime analysis system to function effectively, information should be disseminated to the appropriate units or persons on a timely basis. Information that is relevant to the operational and tactical plans of specific line units should be sent
        directly to them. Information relevant to the development of the Department's strategic plans should be provided to the appropriate staff units. When information pertains to tactical and strategic plans, it should be provided to all affected units.</p>
