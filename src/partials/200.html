    <h3>200.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>The organizational structure of the Department is designed to create an efficient means to accomplish the mission and goals and to provide for the best possible service to the public.</p>

    <h3>200.2 DIVISIONS</h3>

    <ul>
        <li>Administration Division</li>
        <li>Patrol Division</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>200.2.1 ADMINISTRATION DIVISION</h4>
    <p>The Administration Division is commanded by a Captain or Lieutenant whose primary responsibility is to provide general management, direction and control for the Administration Division, including management of the Department budget. The Administration Division consists of Support Services and Administrative Services.</p>
    <h4>200.2.2 PATROL DIVISION</h4>
    <p>The Patrol Division is commanded by a Captain, whose primary responsibility is to provide general management, direction and control for the Patrol Division. The Patrol Division consists of Uniformed Patrol.</p>

    <p>Organizational Structure and Responsibility</p>
    <h4>200.3.2 UNITY OF COMMAND</h4>
    <p>The principles of unity of command ensure efficient supervision and control within the Department. Generally, each employee shall be accountable to one supervisor at any time for a given assignment or responsibility. Except where specifically delegated authority may exist by policy or special assignment, any supervisor may temporarily direct any subordinate if an operational necessity exists.</p>
    <h4>200.3.3 ORDERS</h4>
    <p>Members shall respond to and make a good faith and reasonable effort to comply with the lawful order of superior officers and other proper authority.</p>
    <h4>200.3.4 UNLAWFUL AND CONFLICTING ORDERS</h4>
    <p>No member is required to obey any order that outwardly appears to be in direct conflict with any federal law, state law or local ordinance. If the legality of an order is in doubt, the affected member shall ask the issuing supervisor to clarify the order or confer with a higher authority. Responsibility for refusal to obey rests with the member, who shall subsequently be required to justify the refusal.</p>
    <p>Unless it would jeopardize the safety of any individual, members who are presented with an order that is in conflict with a previous order, department policy or other directive, shall respectfully inform the issuing supervisor of the conflict. The issuing supervisor is responsible for either resolving the conflict or clarifying that the order is intended to countermand the previous order or directive, in which case the member is obliged to comply. Members who are compelled to follow a conflicting order after having given the issuing supervisor the opportunity to correct the conflict are not held accountable for disobedience of the order or directive that was initially issued.</p>
    <p>The person countermanding the original order shall notify, in writing, the person issuing the original order, indicating the action taken and the reason therefore.</p>
