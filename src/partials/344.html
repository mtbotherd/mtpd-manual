    <h2>344 - Report Preparation</h2>
    <h3>344.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>Report preparation is a major part of each employee's job. The purpose of reports is to document sufficient information to refresh the employee's memory and to provide sufficient information for follow-up investigation and successful prosecution.
        Report writing is the subject of substantial formalized and on-the-job training.</p>
    <h4>344.1.1 REPORT PREPARATION</h4>
    <p>Employees should ensure that their reports are sufficient for their purpose and reasonably free of errors prior to submission. It is the responsibility of the assigned employee to complete and submit all reports taken during the shift before going
        off-duty, unless permission to hold the report has been approved by a supervisor. Generally, reports requiring prompt follow-up action on active leads, or arrest reports where the suspect remains in custody should not be held.</p>
    <p>Handwritten reports must be prepared legibly. If the report is not legible, the submitting employee will be required by the reviewing supervisor to promptly make corrections and resubmit the report. Employees who dictate reports shall use appropriate
        grammar, as content is not the responsibility of the typist. Employees who generate reports on computers are subject to all requirements of this policy.</p>
    <p>All reports shall accurately reflect the identity of the persons involved, all pertinent information seen, heard or assimilated by any other sense and any actions taken. Employees shall not suppress, conceal or distort the facts of any reported incident
        nor shall any employee make a false report orally or in writing. Generally, the reporting employee's opinions should not be included in reports unless specifically identified as such.</p>

    <h3>344.2 REQUIRED REPORTING</h3>
    <p>Written reports are required in all of the following situations on the appropriate Department- approved form (computerized RMS) unless otherwise approved by a supervisor.</p>
    <h4>344.2.1 CRIMINAL ACTIVITY</h4>
    <p>When a member responds to a call for service, or as a result of self-initiated activity becomes aware of any activity where a crime has occurred, the member shall document the incident regardless of whether a victim desires prosecution.</p>
    <p>Activity to be documented in a written report includes:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>All arrests</li>
        <li>All felony crimes</li>
        <li>All incidents involving violations of crimes or ordinances motivated by bias (Minn. Stat. § 626.5531)</li>
        <li>Non-felony incidents involving threats or stalking behavior</li>
        <li>Situations covered by separate policy. These include:</p>

            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>All misdemeanor crimes where the victim desires a report</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Misdemeanor crimes where the victim does not desire a report shall be documented using the department-approved alternative reporting method (e.g., dispatch log).</p>
    <h4>344.2.2 NON-CRIMINAL ACTIVITY</h4>
    <p>The following incidents shall be documented using the appropriate approved report:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">

        <li>Any use of force against any person by a member of this department (see the Use of Force Policy)</li>
        <li>Any firearm discharge (see the Firearms Policy)</li>
        <li>Any time a person is reported missing, regardless of jurisdiction (see the Missing Persons Policy)</li>
        <li>Any found property or found evidence</li>
        <li>Any traffic collisions above the minimum reporting level (see the Traffic Collisions Policy)</li>
        <li>Suspicious incidents that may indicate a potential for crimes against children or that a child’s safety is in jeopardy</li>
        <li>All protective custody detentions</li>
        <li>Suspicious incidents that may place the public or others at risk</li>
        <li>Whenever the employee believes the circumstances should be documented or at the direction of a supervisor</li>
        <li>Any watercraft collision or accident, drowning death and/or general water accident should be reported on the appropriate Department of Natural Resource Form (Minn. Stat. § 86B.105(a))</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>344.2.3 DEATH REPORTS</h4>
    <p>Reports shall be completed by the handling employee. All deaths shall be handled in compliance with the Death Investigations Policy.</p>
    <h4>344.2.4 INJURY OR DAMAGE BY METROPOLITAN COUNCIL / METRO TRANSIT PERSONNEL</h4>
    <p>Reports shall be taken if an injury occurs that is a result of an act of a Metropolitan Council / Metro Transit employee. Additionally, reports shall be taken involving damage to Metropolitan Council / Metro Transit property or Metropolitan Council

    <h4>344.2.5 MISCELLANEOUS INJURIES</h4>

        <li>The injury is a result of a drug overdose.</li>
        <li>Attempted suicide.</li>
        <li>The injury is major or serious, whereas death could result.</li>
        <li>The circumstances surrounding the incident are suspicious in nature and it is desirable to record the event.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The above reporting requirements are not intended to be all-inclusive. A supervisor may direct an employee to document any incident he/she deems necessary.</p>
    <h4>344.2.6 ALTERNATE REPORTING FOR VICTIMS</h4>
    <p>Reports that may be submitted by the public via online or other self-completed reporting processes include:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Lost property.</li>
        <li>Misdemeanor thefts of property, other than firearms or materials that threaten public safety, when there is no suspect information or serial number or ability to trace the item.
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>Misdemeanor thefts of cellular telephones may be reported even though they have a serial number.</li>
            </ol>

        <li>Hit-and-run vehicle collisions with no suspect or suspect vehicle.</li>
        <li>Supplemental property lists.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Members at the scene of one of the above incidents should not refer the reporting party to an alternate means of reporting without authorization from a supervisor. Members may refer victims to online victim assistance programs (e.g., Federal Communications
        Commission (FCC) website for identity theft, Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) website for computer crimes).</p>

    <h3>344.3 OPTIONAL REPORTING / CAD DISPOSITIONS</h3>
    <p>In March 2015, a report writing process was implemented that no longer requires officers to write on all incidents. This process included the new incident status of "<strong>Case Closed No Report Required</strong>."</p>
    <p>If an incident is given a CAD disposition of: "<strong>Citation</strong>", "<strong>Cleared    by Report</strong>", "<strong>Detox</strong>", "<strong>Transport</strong>" or "<strong>Fail to Clear</strong>", the case status will be "<strong>Open</strong>"
        and a written report is required. The other 12 CAD dispositions will have a case disposition of; "<strong>Case Closed No Report Required</strong>." An officer may still write a report on an incident with a status of "<strong>Case Closed No Report Required</strong>"
        if they choose. Once completed, that incident shall have the status changed to "<strong>Supervisor Review</strong>."</p>

    <h3>344.4 GENERAL POLICY OF EXPEDITIOUS REPORTING</h3>
    <p>In general, all employees and supervisors shall act with promptness and efficiency in the preparation and processing of all reports. An incomplete report, unorganized reports or reports delayed without supervisory approval are not acceptable. Reports
        shall be processed according to established priorities or according to special priority necessary under exceptional circumstances.</p>
    <h4>344.4.1 GENERAL POLICY OF HANDWRITTEN REPORTS</h4>
    <p>Some incidents and report forms lend themselves to block print rather than typing. In general, the narrative portion of those reports where an arrest is made or when there is a long narrative should be typed or dictated.</p>
    <p>Supervisors may require, with the foregoing general policy in mind, block printing or typing of reports of any nature for Department consistency.</p>
    <h4>344.4.2 GENERAL USE OF OTHER HANDWRITTEN FORMS</h4>
    <p>County, state and federal agency forms may be block printed as appropriate. In general, the form itself may make the requirement for typing apparent.</p>

    <h3>344.5 REPORT CORRECTIONS</h3>
    <p>Supervisors shall review reports for content and accuracy. If a correction is necessary, the reviewing supervisor shall notify the employee by stating the reasons for rejection. The original report and the corrections needed should be returned to
        the reporting employee for correction as soon as practicable. This will be done by creating a "task" for the employee in the RMS. It shall be the responsibility of the originating employee to ensure that any report returned for correction is processed
        in a timely manner.</p>

    <h3>344.6 REPORT CHANGES OR ALTERATIONS</h3>
    <p>Reports that have been approved by a supervisor and submitted to the Records Section for filing and distribution shall not be modified or altered except by way of a supplemental report. Reviewed reports that have not yet been submitted to the Records
        Section may be corrected or modified by the authoring employee only with the knowledge and authorization of the reviewing supervisor.</p>

    <h3>344.7 ELECTRONIC SIGNATURES</h3>
    <p>The Metro Transit Police Department has established an electronic signature procedure for use by all employees of the Metro Transit Police Department. The Systems Administrator shall be responsible for maintaining the electronic signature system,
        for ensuring that each employee creates a unique, confidential password for his/her electronic signature and that the use of electronic signatures otherwise complies with the law.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Employees may only use their electronic signature for official reports or other official communications.</li>
        <li>Each employee shall be responsible for the security and use of his/her electronic signature and shall promptly notify a supervisor if the electronic signature has or may have been compromised or misused.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>344.8 FIREARM INJURY REPORTING FROM HEALTH PROFESSIONALS</h3>
    <p>Members receiving a report from a health professional of a bullet or gunshot wound, powder burns or any other injury arising from, or caused by, the discharge of any gun, pistol or any other firearm shall thoroughly investigate the facts surrounding
        the incident (Minn. Stat. § 626.52, Subd. 2; Minn. Stat. § 626.553, Subd. 1).</p>
    <p>The Records Section shall ensure that the report received from the health professional is forwarded to the commissioner of the Department of Health (Minn. Stat. § 626.53, Subd. 2). If the injury resulted from a hunting incident, the Records Section
        shall ensure that the findings of the investigation are forwarded to the commissioner of the Department of Natural Resources using the form provided by the commissioner (Minn. Stat. § 626.553, Subd. 1).</p>
