    <h2>309 - Conducted Energy Device</h2>
    <h3>309.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>This policy provides guidelines for the issuance and use of the Conducted Energy Device (CED).</p>

    <h3>309.2 POLICY</h3>
    <p>The TASER device is intended to control a violent or potentially violent individual, while minimizing the risk of serious injury. The appropriate use of such a device should result in fewer serious injuries to officers and suspects.</p>

    <h3>309.3 ISSUANCE AND CARRYING TASER DEVICES</h3>
    <p>Only members who have successfully completed department-approved training may be issued and carry the TASER device.</p>
    <p>TASER devices are issued for use during a member's current assignment. Those leaving a particular assignment may be required to return the device to the department's inventory.</p>
    <p>Officers shall only use the TASER device and cartridges that have been issued by the Department. Uniformed officers who have been issued the TASER device shall wear the device in an approved holster on their person. Non-uniformed officers may secure the TASER device in the driver's compartment of their vehicle.</p>
    <p>Members carrying the TASER device should perform a spark test on the unit prior to every shift.</p>
    <p>When carried while in uniform, officers shall carry the TASER device in a weak-side holster on the side opposite the duty weapon.</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>All TASER devices shall be clearly and distinctly marked to differentiate them from the duty weapon and any other device.</li>
        <li>Whenever practicable, officers should carry two or more cartridges on their person when carrying the TASER device.</li>
        <li>Officers shall be responsible for ensuring that their issued TASER device is properly maintained and in good working order.</li>
        <li>Officers should not hold both a firearm and the TASER device at the same time.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>309.4 VERBAL AND VISUAL WARNINGS</h3>
    <p>A verbal warning of the intended use of the TASER device should precede its application, unless it would otherwise endanger the safety of officers or when it is not practicable due to the circumstances. The purpose of the warning is to:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Provide the individual with a reasonable opportunity to voluntarily comply.</li>
        <li>Provide other officers and individuals with a warning that the TASER device may be deployed.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If, after a verbal warning, an individual is unwilling to voluntarily comply with an officer's lawful orders and it appears both reasonable and feasible under the circumstances, the officer may, but is not required to, display the electrical arc (provided that a cartridge has not been loaded into the device), or the laser in a further attempt to gain compliance prior to the application of the TASER device. The aiming laser should never be intentionally directed into the eyes of another as it may permanently impair his/her vision.</p>
    <p>The fact that a verbal or other warning was given or the reasons it was not given shall be documented by the officer deploying the TASER device in the related report.</p>

    <h3>309.5 DOCUMENTATION</h3>
    <p>Officers shall document all TASER device discharges in the related arrest/crime report and the TASER device report form. Notification shall also be made to a supervisor in compliance with the Use of Force Policy. Unintentional discharges, pointing the device at a person, laser activation and arcing the device will also be documented on the report form.</p>
    <h4>309.5.1 TASER DEVICE FORM</h4>
    <p>Items that shall be included in the TASER device report form are:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>The type and brand of TASER device and cartridge and cartridge serial number.</li>
        <li>Date, time and location of the incident.</li>
        <li>Whether any display, laser or arc deterred a subject and gained compliance.</li>
        <li>The number of TASER device activations, the duration of each cycle, the duration between activations, and (as best as can be determined) the duration that the subject received applications.</li>
        <li>The range at which the TASER device was used.</li>
        <li>The type of mode used (probe or drive-stun).</li>
        <li>Location of any probe impact.</li>
        <li>Location of contact in drive-stun mode.</li>
        <li>Description of where missed probes went.</li>
        <li>Whether medical care was provided to the subject.</li>
        <li>Whether the subject sustained any injuries.</li>
        <li>Whether any officers sustained any injuries.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The Training Coordinator should periodically analyze the report forms to identify trends, including deterrence and effectiveness. The Training Coordinator should also conduct audits of data downloads and reconcile TASER device report forms with recorded activations. If requested, TASER device information and statistics, with identifying information removed, should periodically be made available to the public.</p>
    <h4>309.5.2 REPORTS</h4>
    <p>The officer should include the following in the arrest/crime report:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Identification of all personnel firing TASER devices</li>
        <li>Identification of all witnesses</li>
        <li>Medical care provided to the subject</li>
        <li>Observations of the subject's physical and physiological actions</li>
        <li>Any known or suspected drug use, intoxication or other medical problems</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>309.6 MEDICAL TREATMENT</h3>
    <p>Metro Transit Police Department officers may carefully remove TASER device darts from a person's body following routine application of the TASER device. Used TASER device probes shall be treated as a sharps biohazard, similar to a used hypodermic needle, and handled appropriately. Universal precautions should be taken.</p>
    <p>All persons who have been struck by TASER device probes or who have been subjected to the electric discharge of the device shall be medically assessed prior to booking. Additionally, any such individual who falls under any of the following categories should, as soon as practicable, be examined by paramedics or other qualified medical personnel:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>The person is suspected of being under the influence of controlled substances and/or alcohol.</li>
        <li>The person may be pregnant.</li>
        <li>The person reasonably appears to be in need of medical attention.</li>
        <li>The TASER device probes are lodged in a sensitive area (e.g., groin, female breast, head, face, neck).</li>
        <li>The person requests medical treatment.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Any individual exhibiting signs of distress or who is exposed to multiple or prolonged applications (i.e., more than 15 seconds) shall be transported to a medical facility for examination or medically evaluated prior to booking. If any individual refuses medical attention, such a refusal should be witnessed by another officer and/or medical personnel and shall be fully documented in related</p>
    <p>reports. If an audio recording is made of the contact or an interview with the individual, any refusal should be included, if possible.</p>
    <p>The transporting officer shall inform any person providing medical care or receiving custody that the individual has been subjected to the application of the TASER device.</p>

    <h3>309.7 SUPERVISOR RESPONSIBILITIES</h3>
    <p>A supervisor should review each incident where a person has been exposed to an activation of the TASER device. The supervisor shall complete a supplement under the related case report.</p>

    <h3>309.8 TRAINING</h3>
    <p>Personnel who are authorized to carry the TASER device shall be permitted to do so only after successfully completing the initial department-approved training. Any personnel who have not carried the TASER device as a part of their assignment for a period of six months or more shall be recertified by a department-approved TASER device instructor prior to again carrying or using the device.</p>
    <p>Proficiency training for personnel who have been issued TASER devices should occur every year. A reassessment of an officer's knowledge and/or practical skill may be required at any time if deemed appropriate by the Training Coordinator. All training and proficiency for TASER devices will be documented in the officer's training file.</p>
    <p>Command staff, supervisors and investigators should receive TASER device training as appropriate for the investigations they conduct and review.</p>
    <p>Officers who do not carry TASER devices should receive training that is sufficient to familiarize them with the device and with working with officers who use the device.</p>
    <p>The Training Coordinator is responsible for ensuring that all members who carry TASER devices have received initial and annual proficiency training. Periodic audits should be used for verification.</p>
    <p>Application of TASER devices during training could result in injury to personnel and should not be mandatory for certification.</p>
    <p>The Training Coordinator should ensure that all training includes:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>A review of this policy.</li>
        <li>A review of the Use of Force Policy.</li>
        <li>Performing weak-hand draws or cross-draws to reduce the possibility of accidentally drawing and firing a firearm.</li>
        <li>Target area considerations, to include techniques or options to reduce the accidental application of probes near the head, neck, chest and groin.</li>
        <li>Handcuffing a subject during the application of the TASER device and transitioning to other force options.</li>
        <li>De-escalation techniques.</li>
        <li>Restraint techniques that do not impair respiration following the application of the TASER device.</li>
        <li>A review of in-custody death prevention techniques.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>309.9 DOWNLOADING DEVICE INFORMATION</h3>
    <p>The Department will designate an employee who will ensure each TASER Device is downloaded annually to retrieve deployment information and to ensure the internal clock of the TASER Device is appropriately set. All TASER Device deployment information will be maintained by the Department for no less than the period of time established by the Metro Transit Police Department records retention schedule, after which they may be considered for disposal.</p>
    <p>TASER Devices may be downloaded following a particular incident if the Administration determines that it may be necessary.</p>
