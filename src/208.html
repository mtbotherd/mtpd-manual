    </ol>

    <h3>208.5 TRAINING NEEDS ASSESSMENT</h3>
    <p>The Professional Standards Unit will conduct an annual training-needs assessment and complete a report of the training-needs assessment, including recommendations from the Training Committee. The training-needs assessment report will be provided to the Chief of Police. Upon review and approval by the Chief of Police, the needs assessment will form the basis for the training plan for the ensuing fiscal year.</p>

    <h3>208.6 TRAINING COMMITTEE</h3>
    <p>The Training Coordinator shall establish a Training Committee, which will serve to assist with identifying training needs for the Department.</p>
    <p>The Training Committee shall be comprised of at least three members, with one member of the committee acting as the chairperson. That person will be selected by the Training Committee members. Members should be elected based on their abilities at post-incident evaluation and at assessing related training needs. The Training Coordinator may remove or replace members of the committee at his/her discretion.</p>
    <p>The Training Committee should review certain incidents to determine whether training would likely improve future outcomes or reduce or prevent the recurrence of the undesirable issues related to the incident. Specific incidents the Training Committee should review include, but are not limited to:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Any incident involving the death or serious injury of an employee.</li>
        <li>Incidents involving a high risk of death, serious injury or civil liability.</li>
        <li>Incidents identified by a supervisor as appropriate to review to identify possible training needs.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The Training Committee should convene on a regular basis as determined by the Training Coordinator to review the identified incidents. The committee shall determine by consensus whether a training need exists and then submit written recommendations of its findings to the Training Coordinator. The recommendation should not identify specific facts of any incidents, such as identities of employees involved or the date, time and location of the incident, but should focus on the type of training being recommended.</p>
    <p>The Training Coordinator will consider the recommendations of the committee and determine what training should be addressed, taking into consideration the mission of the Department and available resources.</p>

    <h3>208.7 TRAINING RECORDS</h3>
    <p>The Training Coordinator is responsible for the creation, filing and storage of all training records in compliance with POST standards. Training records shall be retained as long as the employee's personnel file is retained.</p>

    <h3>208.8 REPORTING TRAINING TO POST</h3>
    <p>The POST Board distributes license renewals directly to licensed peace officers and requires the licensee to report completed continuing education courses from the previous license period. Officers are responsible for responding to these requests in a timely manner and otherwise maintaining their licensed status.</p>

    <h3>208.9 DAILY TRAINING BULLETINS</h3>
    <p>The Lexipol Daily Training Bulletins (DTBs) are contained in a web-accessed system that provides training on the Metro Transit Police Department policy manual and other important topics. Generally, one training bulletin is available for each day of the month. However, the number of DTBs may be adjusted by the Training Coordinator.</p>
    <p>Personnel assigned to participate in DTBs shall only use login credentials assigned to them by the Training Coordinator or designee. Personnel should not share their password with others and should frequently change their password to protect the security of the system. After each session, employees should logoff the system to prevent unauthorized access. The content of the DTBs is copyrighted material and shall not be shared with others outside of the Department.</p>
    <p>Employees who are assigned to participate in the DTB program should complete each DTB at the beginning of their shift, or as otherwise directed by their supervisor. Employees should not allow uncompleted DTBs to build up over time. Personnel may be required to complete DTBs missed during extended absences (e.g., vacation, medical leave) upon returning to duty. Although the DTB system can be accessed from any Internet active computer, employees shall only take DTBs as part of their on-duty assignment unless directed otherwise by a supervisor.</p>
    <p>The Training Coordinator will be responsible for monitoring the progress of personnel to ensure compliance with this policy.</p>

    <h3>208.10 CLASSROOM DISCRIMINATION</h3>
    <p>The Training Coordinator shall ensure that procedures for the investigation and resolution of allegations of classroom discrimination are developed and implemented, and include the required elements (Minn. R. 6700.0900; Minn. R. 6700.0902).</p>
