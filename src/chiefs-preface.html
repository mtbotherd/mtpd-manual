    <h2>Chief's Preface</h2>
    <p>This Metro Transit Police Department policy manual has been developed to provide the framework to guide you in the performance of our law enforcement mission. These policies have been established as a result of an ever-changing assimilation of legal and best-practice principles in the law enforcement profession. This manual, together with your training and your professional discretion, will provide you the tools to carry out your responsibilities.</p>
    <p>All personnel are required to be familiar with the directives in this manual and, when necessary, seek guidance from a supervisor. Department members are encouraged to submit recommendations for constructive changes to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our operations. This manual will be updated as necessary to reflect changes in the law, best practices, personnel responsibilities as well as department goals and objectives.</p>
