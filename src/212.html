    <h2>212 - Electronic Mail</h2>
    <h3>212.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this policy is to establish guidelines for the proper use and application of the electronic mail (email) system provided by the Department / Metropolitan Council. Email is a communication tool available to employees to enhance efficiency in the performance of job duties. It is to be used in accordance with generally accepted business practices, Metropolitan Council policy and current law (e.g., Minnesota Data Practices Act). Messages transmitted over the email system must only be those that involve official business activities or contain information essential to employees for the accomplishment of business-related tasks and/or communication directly related to the business, administration or practices of the Department.</p>

    <h3>212.2 EMAIL RIGHT OF PRIVACY</h3>
    <p>All email messages, including attachments, transmitted over the Department / Metropolitan Council computer network or accessed through a web browser accessing the Department / Metropolitan Council system are considered Department / Metropolitan Council records and, therefore, are the property of the Department / Metropolitan Council. The Department / Metropolitan Council has the right to access, audit and disclose for whatever reason, all messages, including attachments, transmitted or received through its email system or placed into its storage.</p>
    <p>Unless it is encrypted, the email system is not a confidential system since all communications transmitted on, to or from the system are the property of the Department / Metropolitan Council. Therefore, the email system is not appropriate for confidential or personal communication. If a communication must be private, an alternative method to communicate the message should be used instead of email. Employees using the Department / Metropolitan Council email system shall have no expectation of privacy concerning communications utilizing the system.</p>

    <h3>212.3 PROHIBITED USE OF EMAIL</h3>
    <p>The Department / Metropolitan Council email system shall not be used for personal purposes unless that use is authorized in writing by the Chief of Police.</p>
    <p>Sending derogatory, defamatory, obscene, disrespectful, sexually suggestive and harassing or any other inappropriate messages on the email system is prohibited, will constitute just cause for discipline, and will result in discipline, up to and including termination of employment</p>
    <p>Email messages addressed to the entire department are only to be used for official business- related items that are of particular interest to all users and must be approved by the Chief of Police or designee. Personal advertisements or announcements are not permitted.</p>
    <p>It is a violation of this policy to transmit a message under another user's name or email address or to use the password of another to log onto the system. Users are required to log off the network or lock the workstation when their computer is unattended. This added security measure would minimize the misuse of an individual's email, name and/or password.</p>

    <h3>212.4 EMAIL RECORD MANAGEMENT</h3>
    <p>Email may, depending upon the individual content, be a public record under the Minnesota Data Practices Act and must be managed in accordance with the established records retention schedule and in compliance with state law.</p>
    <p>The Custodian of Records shall ensure that email messages are retained and recoverable as outlined in the Records Maintenance and Release Policy.</p>
