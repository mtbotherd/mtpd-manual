    <h2>Chief's Preface</h2>
    <p>This Metro Transit Police Department policy manual has been developed to provide the framework to guide you in the performance of our law enforcement mission. These policies have been established as a result of an ever-changing assimilation of legal and best-practice principles in the law enforcement profession. This manual, together with your training and your professional discretion, will provide you the tools to carry out your responsibilities.</p>
    <p>All personnel are required to be familiar with the directives in this manual and, when necessary, seek guidance from a supervisor. Department members are encouraged to submit recommendations for constructive changes to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our operations. This manual will be updated as necessary to reflect changes in the law, best practices, personnel responsibilities as well as department goals and objectives.</p>
</div>

            <div class="chapter" id="law-enforcement-code-of-ethics">
    <h2>Law Enforcement Code of Ethics</h2>
    <p>As a law enforcement officer, my fundamental duty is to serve the community; to safeguard lives and property; to protect the innocent against deception, the weak against oppression or intimidation and the peaceful against abuse or disorder; and to respect the constitutional rights of all to liberty, equality and justice.</p>
    <p>I will keep my private life unsullied as an example to all and will behave in a manner that does not bring discredit to me or to my agency. I will maintain courageous calm in the face of danger, scorn or ridicule; develop self-restraint; and be constantly mindful of the welfare of others. Honest in thought and deed both in my personal and official life, I will be exemplary in obeying the law and the regulations of my department. Whatever I see or hear of a confidential nature or that is confided to me in my official capacity will be kept ever secret unless revelation is necessary in the performance of my duty.</p>
    <p>I will never act officiously or permit personal feelings, prejudices, political beliefs, aspirations, animosities or friendships to influence my decisions. With no compromise for crime and with relentless prosecution of criminals, I will enforce the law courteously and appropriately without fear or favor, malice or ill will, never employing unnecessary force or abuse and never accepting gratuities.</p>
    <p>I recognize the badge of my office as a symbol of public faith, and I accept it as a public trust to be held so long as I am true to the ethics of police service. I will never engage in acts of corruption or bribery, nor will I condone such acts by other police officers. I will cooperate with all legally authorized agencies and their representatives in the pursuit of justice.</p>
    <p>I know that I alone am responsible for my own standard of professional performance and will take every reasonable opportunity to enhance and improve my level of knowledge and competence.</p>

    <h4>100.2.2 ARREST AUTHORITY OUTSIDE THE JURISDICTION OF THE METRO TRANSIT POLICE DEPARTMENT</h4>
    <p>Full-time, on-duty officers may make an arrest outside the jurisdiction of the Metro Transit Police Department anytime the officer may by law make an arrest for a criminal offense and the person to be arrested escapes from custody or flees out of the officer’s jurisdiction (Minn.

The recommendation should not identify specific facts of any incidents, such as identities of employees involved or the date, time and location of the incident, but should focus on the type of training being recommended.</p>
    <p>The Training Coordinator will consider the recommendations of the committee and determine what training should be addressed, taking into consideration the mission of the Department and available resources.</p>

    <h3>208.7 TRAINING RECORDS</h3>
    <p>The Training Coordinator is responsible for the creation, filing and storage of all training records in compliance with POST standards. Training records shall be retained as long as the employee's personnel file is retained.</p>

    <h3>208.8 REPORTING TRAINING TO POST</h3>
    <p>The POST Board distributes license renewals directly to licensed peace officers and requires the licensee to report completed continuing education courses from the previous license period. Officers are responsible for responding to these requests in a timely manner and otherwise maintaining their licensed status.</p>

    <h3>208.9 DAILY TRAINING BULLETINS</h3>
    <p>The Lexipol Daily Training Bulletins (DTBs) are contained in a web-accessed system that provides training on the Metro Transit Police Department policy manual and other important topics. Generally, one training bulletin is available for each day of the month. However, the number of DTBs may be adjusted by the Training Coordinator.</p>
    <p>Personnel assigned to participate in DTBs shall only use login credentials assigned to them by the Training Coordinator or designee. Personnel should not share their password with others and should frequently change their password to protect the security of the system. After each session, employees should logoff the system to prevent unauthorized access. The content of the DTBs is copyrighted material and shall not be shared with others outside of the Department.</p>
    <p>Employees who are assigned to participate in the DTB program should complete each DTB at the beginning of their shift, or as otherwise directed by their supervisor. Employees should not allow uncompleted DTBs to build up over time. Personnel may be required to complete DTBs missed during extended absences (e.g., vacation, medical leave) upon returning to duty. Although the DTB system can be accessed from any Internet active computer, employees shall only take DTBs as part of their on-duty assignment unless directed otherwise by a supervisor.</p>
    <p>The Training Coordinator will be responsible for monitoring the progress of personnel to ensure compliance with this policy.</p>

    <h3>208.10 CLASSROOM DISCRIMINATION</h3>
    <p>The Training Coordinator shall ensure that procedures for the investigation and resolution of allegations of classroom discrimination are developed and implemented, and include the required elements (Minn. R. 6700.0900; Minn. R. 6700.0902).</p>

    <h2>212 - Electronic Mail</h2>
    <h3>212.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this policy is to establish guidelines for the proper use and application of the electronic mail (email) system provided by the Department / Metropolitan Council. Email is a communication tool available to employees to enhance efficiency in the performance of job duties. It is to be used in accordance with generally accepted business practices, Metropolitan Council policy and current law (e.g., Minnesota Data Practices Act). Messages transmitted over the email system must only be those that involve official business activities or contain information essential to employees for the accomplishment of business-related tasks and/or communication directly related to the business, administration or practices of the Department.</p>

    <h3>212.2 EMAIL RIGHT OF PRIVACY</h3>
    <p>All email messages, including attachments, transmitted over the Department / Metropolitan Council computer network or accessed through a web browser accessing the Department / Metropolitan Council system are considered Department / Metropolitan Council records and, therefore, are the property of the Department / Metropolitan Council. The Department / Metropolitan Council has the right to access, audit and disclose for whatever reason, all messages, including attachments, transmitted or received through its email system or placed into its storage.</p>
    <p>Unless it is encrypted, the email system is not a confidential system since all communications transmitted on, to or from the system are the property of the Department / Metropolitan Council. Therefore, the email system is not appropriate for confidential or personal communication. If a communication must be private, an alternative method to communicate the message should be used instead of email. Employees using the Department / Metropolitan Council email system shall have no expectation of privacy concerning communications utilizing the system.</p>

    <h3>212.3 PROHIBITED USE OF EMAIL</h3>
    <p>The Department / Metropolitan Council email system shall not be used for personal purposes unless that use is authorized in writing by the Chief of Police.</p>
    <p>Sending derogatory, defamatory, obscene, disrespectful, sexually suggestive and harassing or any other inappropriate messages on the email system is prohibited, will constitute just cause for discipline, and will result in discipline, up to and including termination of employment</p>
    <p>Email messages addressed to the entire department are only to be used for official business- related items that are of particular interest to all users and must be approved by the Chief of Police or designee. Personal advertisements or announcements are not permitted.</p>
    <p>It is a violation of this policy to transmit a message under another user's name or email address or to use the password of another to log onto the system. Users are required to log off the network or lock the workstation when their computer is unattended. This added security measure would minimize the misuse of an individual's email, name and/or password.</p>

    <h3>212.4 EMAIL RECORD MANAGEMENT</h3>
    <p>Email may, depending upon the individual content, be a public record under the Minnesota Data Practices Act and must be managed in accordance with the established records retention schedule and in compliance with state law.</p>
    <p>The Custodian of Records shall ensure that email messages are retained and recoverable as outlined in the Records Maintenance and Release Policy.</p>

            <div class="chapter" id="300">
    <h2>300 - Use of Force</h2>
    <h3>300.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>This policy provides guidelines on the reasonable use of force. While there is no way to specify the exact amount or type of reasonable force to be applied in any situation, every member of this department is expected to use these guidelines to make such decisions in a professional, impartial and reasonable manner.</p>
    <h4>300.1.1 DEFINITIONS</h4>
    <p>Definitions related to this policy include:</p>
    <p><strong>Deadly force</strong> - Force reasonably anticipated and intended to create a substantial likelihood of causing death or very serious injury.</p>
    <p><strong>Force</strong> - The application of physical techniques or tactics, chemical agents or weapons to another person. It is not a use of force when a person allows him/herself to be searched, escorted, handcuffed or restrained.</p>

    <h3>300.2 POLICY</h3>
    <p>The use of force by law enforcement personnel is a matter of critical concern, both to the public and to the law enforcement community. Officers are involved on a daily basis in numerous and varied interactions and, when warranted, may use reasonable force in carrying out their duties.</p>
    <p>Officers must have an understanding of, and true appreciation for, their authority and limitations. This is especially true with respect to overcoming resistance while engaged in the performance of law enforcement duties.</p>
    <p>The Department recognizes and respects the value of all human life and dignity without prejudice to anyone. Vesting officers with the authority to use reasonable force and to protect the public welfare requires monitoring, evaluation and a careful balancing of all interests.</p>
    <h4>300.2.1 DUTY TO INTERCEDE</h3>
    <p>Any officer present and observing another officer using force that is clearly beyond that which is objectively reasonable under the circumstances shall, when in a position to do so, intercede to prevent the use of unreasonable force. An officer who observes another employee use force that exceeds the degree of force permitted by law should promptly report these observations to a supervisor.</p>

    <h3>300.3 USE OF FORCE</h3>
    <p>Officers shall use only that amount of force that reasonably appears necessary given the facts and circumstances perceived by the officer at the time of the event to accomplish a legitimate law enforcement purpose. Officers are encouraged to use de-escalation when/if the facts and circumstances are deemed reasonable.</p>
    <p>The reasonableness of force will be judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene at the time of the incident. Any evaluation of reasonableness must allow for the fact that</p>
    <p>officers are often forced to make split-second decisions about the amount of force that reasonably appears necessary in a particular situation, with limited information and in circumstances that are tense, uncertain and rapidly evolving.</p>
    <p>Given that no policy can realistically predict every possible situation an officer might encounter, officers are entrusted to use well-reasoned discretion in determining the appropriate use of force in each incident.</p>
    <p>It is also recognized that circumstances may arise in which officers reasonably believe that it would be impractical or ineffective to use any of the tools, weapons or methods provided by the Department. Officers may find it more effective or reasonable to improvise their response to rapidly unfolding conditions that they are confronting. In such circumstances, the use of any improvised device or method must nonetheless be reasonable and utilized only to the degree that reasonably appears necessary to accomplish a legitimate law enforcement purpose.</p>
    <p>While the ultimate objective of every law enforcement encounter is to avoid or minimize injury, nothing in this policy requires an officer to retreat or be exposed to possible physical injury before applying reasonable force.</p>
    <h4>300.3.1 USE OF FORCE TO EFFECT AN ARREST</h4>
    <p>An officer may use reasonable force (Minn. Stat. § 609.06 and Minn. Stat. § 629.33):</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>In effecting a lawful arrest.</li>
        <li>In the execution of a legal process.</li>
        <li>In enforcing an order of the court.</li>
        <li>In executing any other duty imposed by law.</li>
        <li>In preventing the escape, or to retake following the escape, of a person lawfully held on a charge or conviction of a crime.</li>
        <li>In restraining a person with a mental illness or a person with a developmental disability from self-injury or injury to another.</li>
        <li>In self defense or defense of another.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>An officer who makes or attempts to make an arrest need not retreat or desist from his/her efforts by reason of resistance or threatened resistance of the person being arrested; nor shall such officer be deemed the aggressor or lose his/her right to self-defense by the use of reasonable force to effect the arrest or to prevent escape or to overcome resistance.</p>
    <h4>300.3.2 FACTORS USED TO DETERMINE THE REASONABLENESS OF FORCE</h4>
    <p>When determining whether to apply force and evaluating whether an officer has used reasonable force, a number of factors should be taken into consideration, as time and circumstances permit. These factors include, but are not limited to:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Immediacy and severity of the threat to officers or others.</li>
        <li>The conduct of the individual being confronted, as reasonably perceived by the officer at the time.</li>
        <li>Officer/subject factors (age, size, relative strength, skill level, injuries sustained, level of exhaustion or fatigue, the number of officers available vs. subjects).</li>
        <li>The effects of drugs or alcohol.</li>
        <li>Subject’s mental state or capacity.</li>
        <li>Proximity of weapons or dangerous improvised devices.</li>
        <li>The degree to which the subject has been effectively restrained and his/her ability to resist despite being restrained.</li>
        <li>The availability of other options and their possible effectiveness.</li>
        <li>Seriousness of the suspected offense or reason for contact with the individual.</li>
        <li>Training and experience of the officer.</li>
        <li>Potential for injury to officers, suspects and others.</li>
        <li>Whether the person appears to be resisting, attempting to evade arrest by flight or is attacking the officer.</li>
        <li>The risk and reasonably foreseeable consequences of escape.</li>
        <li>The apparent need for immediate control of the subject or a prompt resolution of the situation.</li>
        <li>Whether the conduct of the individual being confronted no longer reasonably appears to pose an imminent threat to the officer or others.</li>
        <li>Prior contacts with the subject or awareness of any propensity for violence.</li>
        <li>Any other exigent circumstances.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>300.3.3 PAIN COMPLIANCE TECHNIQUES</h4>
    <p>Pain compliance techniques may be effective in controlling a physically or actively resisting individual. Officers may only apply those pain compliance techniques for which they have successfully completed department-approved training. Officers utilizing any pain compliance technique should consider:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>The degree to which the application of the technique may be controlled given the level of resistance.</li>
        <li>Whether the person can comply with the direction or orders of the officer.</li>
        <li>Whether the person has been given sufficient opportunity to comply.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The application of any pain compliance technique shall be discontinued once the officer determines that compliance has been achieved.</p>
    <h4>300.3.4 CAROTID CONTROL</h4>
    <p>The proper application of the carotid control hold may be effective in restraining a violent or combative individual. However, due to the potential for injury, the use of the carotid control hold is subject to the following:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>The officer shall have successfully completed department-approved training in the use and application of the carotid control hold.</li>
        <li>The carotid control hold may only be used when circumstances perceived by the officer at the time indicate that such application reasonably appears necessary to control a person in any of the following circumstances:</p>
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>The subject is violent or physically resisting.</li>
                <li>The subject, by words or actions, has demonstrated an intention to be violent and reasonably appears to have the potential to harm officers, him/herself or others.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>The application of a carotid control hold on the following individuals should generally be avoided unless the totality of the circumstances indicates that other available options reasonably appear ineffective, or would present a greater danger to the officer, the subject or others, and the officer reasonably believes that the need to control the individual outweighs the risk of applying a carotid control hold:</p>
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>Females who are known to be pregnant</li>
                <li>Elderly individuals</li>
                <li>Obvious juveniles</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Any individual who has had the carotid control hold applied, and he/she was rendered unconscious, shall be promptly examined by paramedics or other qualified medical personnel and should be monitored until examined by paramedics or other appropriate medical personnel.</li>
        <li>The officer shall inform any person receiving custody, or any person placed in a position of providing care, that the individual has been subjected to the carotid control hold and whether the subject lost consciousness as a result.</li>
        <li>Any officer attempting or applying the carotid control hold shall promptly notify a supervisor of the use or attempted use of such hold.</li>
        <li>The use or attempted use of the carotid control hold shall be thoroughly documented by the officer in any related reports.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>A carotid control hold (or vascular neck restraint) is different from a "choke" hold. Vascular compression affects veins and arteries whereas a "choke" compresses the airway, windpipe or throat etc. A "choke" hold is considered deadly force.</p>

    <h3>300.4 DEADLY FORCE</h3>
    <p>Use of deadly force is justified in the following circumstances:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>An officer may use deadly force to protect him/herself or others from what he/she reasonably believes would be an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury.</li>
        <li>An officer may use deadly force to stop a fleeing subject when the officer has probable cause to believe that the person has committed, or intends to commit, a felony involving the infliction or threatened infliction of serious bodily injury or death, and the officer reasonably believes that there is an imminent risk of serious bodily injury or death to any other person if the subject is not immediately apprehended. Under such circumstances, a verbal warning should precede the use of deadly force, where feasible.<br/><br/>
        Imminent does not mean immediate or instantaneous. An imminent danger may exist even if the suspect is not at that very moment pointing a weapon at someone. For example, an imminent danger may exist if an officer reasonably believes any of the following:
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>The person has a weapon or is attempting to access one and it is reasonable to believe the person intends to use it against the officer or another.</li>
                <li>The person is capable of causing serious bodily injury or death without a weapon and it is reasonable to believe the person intends to do so.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>300.4.1 SHOOTING AT OR FROM MOVING VEHICLES</h4>
    <p>Shots fired at or from a moving vehicle are rarely effective. Officers should move out of the path of an approaching vehicle instead of discharging their firearm at the vehicle or any of its occupants. An officer should only discharge a firearm at a moving vehicle or its occupants when the officer reasonably believes there are no other reasonable means available to avert the threat of the vehicle, or if deadly force other than the vehicle is directed at the officer or others.</p>
    <p>Officers should not shoot at any part of a vehicle in an attempt to disable the vehicle.</p>

    <h3>300.5 REPORTING THE USE OF FORCE</h3>
    <p>Any use of force by a member of this department shall be documented promptly, completely and accurately in an appropriate report, depending on the nature of the incident. The officer should articulate the factors perceived and why he/she believed the use of force was reasonable under the circumstances. To collect data for purposes of training, resource allocation, analysis and related purposes, the Department may require the completion of additional report forms, as specified in department policy, procedure or law.</p>
    <h4>300.5.1 NOTIFICATION TO SUPERVISORS</h4>
    <p>Supervisory notification shall be made as soon as practicable following the application of force in any of the following circumstances:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>The application caused a visible injury.</li>
        <li>The application would lead a reasonable officer to conclude that the individual may have experienced more than momentary discomfort.</li>
        <li>The individual subjected to the force complained of injury or continuing pain.</li>
        <li>The individual indicates intent to pursue litigation.</li>
        <li>Any application of an Conducted Energy Device (CED) or control device.</li>
        <li>Any application of a restraint device other than handcuffs, shackles or belly chains.</li>
        <li>The individual subjected to the force was rendered unconscious.</li>
        <li>An individual was struck or kicked.</li>
        <li>An individual alleges any of the above has occurred.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>300.6 MEDICAL CONSIDERATION</h3>
    <p>Prior to booking or release, medical assistance shall be obtained for any person who exhibits signs of physical distress, who has sustained visible injury, expresses a complaint of injury or continuing pain, or who was rendered unconscious. Any individual exhibiting signs of physical distress after an encounter should be continuously monitored until he/she can be medically assessed.</p>
    <p>Based upon the officer’s initial assessment of the nature and extent of the subject’s injuries, medical assistance may consist of examination by fire personnel, paramedics, hospital staff or medical staff at the jail. If any such individual refuses medical attention, such a refusal shall be fully documented in related reports and, whenever practicable, should be witnessed by another officer and/or medical personnel. If a recording is made of the contact or an interview with the individual, any refusal should be included in the recording, if possible.</p>
    <p>The on-scene supervisor, or if not available, the primary handling officer shall ensure that any person providing medical care or receiving custody of a person following any use of force is informed that the person was subjected to force. This notification shall include a description of the force used and any other circumstances the officer reasonably believes would be potential safety or medical risks to the subject (e.g., prolonged struggle, extreme agitation, impaired respiration).</p>
    <p>Persons who exhibit extreme agitation, violent irrational behavior accompanied by profuse sweating, extraordinary strength beyond their physical characteristics and imperviousness to pain (sometimes called “excited delirium”), or who require a protracted physical encounter with multiple officers to be brought under control, may be at an increased risk of sudden death. Calls involving these persons should be considered medical emergencies. Officers who reasonably suspect a medical emergency should request medical assistance as soon as practicable and have medical personnel stage away if appropriate.</p>

    <h3>300.7 SUPERVISOR RESPONSIBILITY</h3>
    <p>When a supervisor is able to respond to an incident in which there has been a reported application of force, the supervisor is expected to:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Obtain the basic facts from the involved officers. Absent an allegation of misconduct or excessive force, this will be considered a routine contact in the normal course of duties.</li>
        <li>Ensure that any injured parties are examined and treated.</li>
        <li>When possible, separately obtain a recorded interview with the subject upon whom force was applied. The fact that a recorded interview was conducted should be documented in a report and the recording should be retained until all potential for civil litigation has expired.</li>
        <li>Once any initial medical assessment has been completed or first aid has been rendered, ensure that photographs have been taken of any areas involving visible injury or complaint of pain, as well as overall photographs of uninjured areas. These photographs should be retained until all potential for civil litigation has expired.</li>
        <li>Identify any witnesses not already included in related reports.</li>
        <li>Review and approve all related reports.</li>
        <li>Determine if there is any indication that the subject may pursue civil litigation.</p>
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>If there is an indication of potential civil litigation, the supervisor should complete and route a notification of a potential claim through the appropriate channels.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Evaluate the circumstances surrounding the incident and initiate an administrative investigation if there is a question of policy non-compliance or if for any reason further investigation may be appropriate.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>In the event that a supervisor is unable to respond to the scene of an incident involving the reported application of force, the supervisor is still expected to complete as many of the above items as circumstances permit.</p>
    <h4>300.7.1 SHIFT SUPERVISOR RESPONSIBILITY</h4>
    <p>The Shift Supervisor shall review each use of force by any personnel within his/her command to ensure compliance with this policy and to address any training issues.</p>

    <h3>300.8 TRAINING</h3>
    <p>Officers will receive training on this policy, including the learning objectives as provided by POST, at least annually (Minn. Stat. § 626.8452, Subd. 3).</p>

    <h2>302 - Use of Force Review Boards</h2>
    <h3>302.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>This policy establishes a process for the Metro Transit Police Department to administratively review the use of force by its employees.</p>
    <p>The purpose of the Use of Force Review Board is to review such incidents and determine whether policy, training, weapon or equipment issues should be addressed. The Board shall only forward a report to the Chief of Police recommending policy changes, training needs, weapons or equipment upgrades.</p>

    <h3>302.2 POLICY</h3>
    <p>The Metro Transit Police Department will objectively evaluate the use of force by its members to ensure that their authority is used lawfully, appropriately and is consistent with training and policy.</p>

    <h3>302.3 REMOVAL FROM LINE DUTY ASSIGNMENTS</h3>
    <p>Generally, whenever an employee's actions or use of force in an official capacity, or while using department equipment, results in death or very serious injury to another, that employee will be placed in a temporary administrative assignment pending an administrative review. The Chief of Police may exercise discretion and choose not to place an employee in an administrative assignment in any case.</p>

    <h3>302.4 REVIEW BOARD</h3>
    <p>The Use of Force Review Board will meet on a quarterly basis or be convened as necessary to review the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Any incident where an officer discharges any firearm, on- or off-duty, including accidental discharges. This does not include firearms training, euthanizing injured animals or during legally recognized recreational activity.</li>
        <li>Any incident where an officer has had force used against them which has caused death, great bodily harm or serious injury.</li>
        <li>Any incident where the officer has used force which resulted in death, great bodily harm or serious injury.</li>
        <li>Any incident where an officer has been disarmed.</li>
        <li>Any other incident with an unusual occurrence and/or critical incident.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The Chief of Police may request the Use of Force Review Board to investigate the circumstances surrounding any use of force incident.</p>
    <h4>302.4.1 COMPOSITION OF THE BOARD</h4>
    <p>The Training Coordinator should select five Use of Force Review Board members from the following, as appropriate:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Representatives from each training discipline (e.g. Use of Force, Taser, Firearms etc)</li>
        <li>Non-administrative supervisor</li>
        <li>A peer officer</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The Training Coordinator will serve as chairperson on the Use of Force Review Board.</p>
    <h4>302.4.2 RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE BOARD</h4>
    <p>The Use of Force Review Board is empowered to conduct an administrative review and inquiry into the circumstances of an incident. This review will be separate and distinct from any investigation (criminal or internal) of the incident.</p>
    <p>The board does not have the authority to recommend discipline.</p>
    <p>The Chief of Police will determine whether the board should delay its review until after completion of any criminal investigation, review by any prosecutorial body, filing of criminal charges, the decision not to file criminal charges or any other action. The board should be provided all relevant available material from these proceedings for its consideration.</p>
    <p>The review shall be based upon those facts which were reasonably believed or known by the officer at the time of the incident, applying any legal requirements, department policies, procedures and approved training to those facts. Facts later discovered but unknown to the officer at the time shall neither justify nor call into question an officer's decision regarding the use of force.</p>
    <p>At the conclusion of any review, copies of all relevant reports and information will be gathered by the Training Coordinator, compiled into a written report and filed with the Chief of Police. The report shall be for the exclusive and sole use of the Chief of Police. The Chief of Police will determine how the report and recommendations are to be used.</p>

    <h2>306 - Handcuffing and Restraints</h2>
    <h3>306.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>This policy provides guidelines for the use of handcuffs and other restraints during detentions and arrests.</p>

    <h3>306.2 POLICY</h3>
    <p>The Metro Transit Police Department authorizes the use of restraint devices in accordance with this policy, the Use of Force Policy and department training. Restraint devices shall not be used to punish, to display authority or as a show of force.</p>

    <h3>306.3 USE OF RESTRAINTS</h3>
    <p>Only members who have successfully completed Metro Transit Police Department-approved training on the use of restraint devices described in this policy are authorized to use these devices.</p>
    <p>When deciding whether to use any restraint, officers should carefully balance officer safety concerns with factors that include, but are not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The circumstances or crime leading to the arrest.</li>
        <li>The demeanor and behavior of the arrested person.</li>
        <li>The age and health of the person.</li>
        <li>Whether the person is known to be pregnant.</li>
        <li>Whether the person has a hearing or speaking disability. In such cases, consideration should be given, safety permitting, to handcuffing to the front in order to allow the person to sign or write notes.</li>
        <li>Whether the person has any other apparent disability.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>306.3.1 RESTRAINT OF DETAINEES</h4>
    <p>Situations may arise where it may be reasonable to restrain an individual who may, after brief investigation, be released without arrest. Unless arrested, the use of restraints on detainees should continue only for as long as is reasonably necessary to assure the safety of officers and others. When deciding whether to remove restraints from a detainee, officers should continuously weigh the safety interests at hand against the continuing intrusion upon the detainee.</p>
    <h4>306.3.2 RESTRAINT OF PREGNANT PERSONS</h4>
    <p>Persons who are known to be pregnant should be restrained in the least restrictive manner that is effective for officer safety.</p>
    <p>No person who is in labor shall be handcuffed or restrained except in extraordinary circumstances and only when a supervisor makes an individualized determination that such restraints are necessary to prevent escape or injury.</p>
    <h4>306.3.3 RESTRAINT OF JUVENILES</h4>
    <p>A juvenile under 14 years of age should not be restrained unless he/she is suspected of a dangerous felony or when the officer has a reasonable suspicion that the juvenile may resist, attempt escape, injure him/herself, injure the officer or damage property.</p>
    <h4>306.3.4 NOTIFICATIONS</h4>
    <p>Whenever an officer transports a person with the use of restraints other than handcuffs, the officer shall inform the jail staff upon arrival at the jail that restraints were used. This notification should include information regarding any other circumstances the officer reasonably believes would be potential safety concerns or medical risks to the subject (e.g., prolonged struggle, extreme agitation, impaired respiration) that may have occurred prior to, or during transportation to the jail.</p>

    <h3>306.4 HANDCUFFS OR PLASTIC CUFFS</h3>
    <p>Handcuffs, including temporary nylon or plastic cuffs, may be used only to restrain a person's hands to ensure officer safety.</p>
    <p>Although recommended for most arrest situations, handcuffing is discretionary and not an absolute requirement of the Department. Officers should consider handcuffing any person they reasonably believe warrants that degree of restraint. However, officers should not conclude that in order to avoid risk every person should be handcuffed, regardless of the circumstances.</p>
    <p>In most situations handcuffs should be applied with the hands behind the person's back. When feasible, handcuffs should be double-locked to prevent tightening, which may cause undue discomfort or injury to the hands or wrists.</p>
    <p>In situations where one pair of handcuffs does not appear sufficient to restrain the individual or may cause unreasonable discomfort due to the person's size, officers should consider alternatives, such as using an additional set of handcuffs or multiple plastic cuffs.</p>
    <p>Handcuffs should be removed as soon as it is reasonable or after the person has been searched and is safely confined within a detention facility.</p>

    <h3>306.5 SPIT HOODS</h3>
    <p>Spit hoods/masks/socks are temporary protective devices designed to prevent the wearer from biting and/or transferring or transmitting fluids (saliva and mucous) to others.</p>
    <p>Spit hoods may be placed upon persons in custody when the officer reasonably believes the person will bite or spit, either on a person or in an inappropriate place. They are generally used during application of a physical restraint, while the person is restrained, or during or after transport.</p>
    <p>Officers utilizing spit hoods should ensure that the spit hood is fastened properly to allow for adequate ventilation and that the restrained person can breathe normally. Officers should provide assistance during the movement of restrained individuals due to the potential for impaired or distorted vision on the part of the individual. Officers should avoid comingling individuals wearing spit hoods with other detainees.</p>
    <p>Spit hoods should not be used in situations where the restrained person is bleeding profusely from the area around the mouth or nose, or if there are indications that the person has a medical condition, such as difficulty breathing or vomiting. In such cases, prompt medical care should be obtained. If the person vomits while wearing a spit hood, the spit hood should be promptly removed and discarded. Persons who have been sprayed with oleoresin capsicum (OC) spray should be thoroughly decontaminated including hair, head and clothing prior to application of a spit hood.</p>
    <p>Those who have been placed in a spit hood should be continually monitored and shall not be left unattended until the spit hood is removed. Spit hoods shall be discarded after each use.</p>

    <h3>306.6 AUXILIARY RESTRAINT DEVICES</h3>
    <p>Auxiliary restraint devices include transport belts, waist or belly chains, transportation chains, leg irons and other similar devices. Auxiliary restraint devices are intended for use during long-term restraint or transportation. They provide additional security and safety without impeding breathing, while permitting adequate movement, comfort and mobility.</p>
    <p>Only department-authorized devices may be used. Any person in auxiliary restraints should be monitored as reasonably appears necessary.</p>

    <h3>306.7 LEG RESTRAINT DEVICES</h3>
    <p>Leg restraints may be used to restrain the legs of a violent or potentially violent person when it is reasonable to do so during the course of detention, arrest or transportation. Only restraint devices approved by the department shall be used. The RIPP Hobble is authorized for use by members of this Department.</p>
    <p>In determining whether to use the leg restraint, officers should consider:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Whether the officer or others could be exposed to injury due to the assaultive or resistant behavior of a suspect.</li>
        <li>Whether it is reasonably necessary to protect the suspect from his/her own actions (e.g., hitting his/her head against the interior of the patrol unit, running away from the arresting officer while handcuffed, kicking at objects or officers).</li>
        <li>Whether it is reasonably necessary to avoid damage to property (e.g., kicking at windows of the patrol unit).</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>306.7.1 GUIDELINES FOR USE OF LEG RESTRAINTS</h3>
    <p>When applying leg restraints the following guidelines should be followed:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>If practicable, officers should notify a supervisor of the intent to apply the leg restraint device. In all cases, a supervisor shall be notified as soon as practicable after the application of the leg restraint device.</li>
        <li>Once applied, absent a medical or other emergency, restraints should remain in place until the officer arrives at the jail or other facility or the person no longer reasonably appears to pose a threat.</li>
        <li>Once secured, the person should be placed in a seated or upright position, secured with a seat belt, and shall not be placed on his/her stomach for an extended period, as this could reduce the person's ability to breathe.</li>
        <li>The restrained person should be continually monitored by an officer while in the leg restraint. The officer should ensure that the person does not roll onto and remain on his/her stomach.</li>
        <li>The officer should look for signs of labored breathing and take appropriate steps to relieve and minimize any obvious factors contributing to this condition.</li>
        <li>When transported by ambulance/paramedic unit, the restrained person should be accompanied by an officer when requested by medical personnel. The transporting officer should describe to medical personnel any unusual behaviors or other circumstances the officer reasonably believes would be potential safety or medical risks to the subject (e.g., prolonged struggle, extreme agitation, impaired respiration).</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>306.8 REQUIRED DOCUMENTATION</h3>
    <p>If an individual is restrained and released without an arrest, the officer shall document the details of the detention and the need for handcuffs or other restraints.</p>
    <p>If an individual is arrested, the use of restraints other than handcuffs shall be documented in the related report. The officer should include, as appropriate:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>The amount of time the suspect was restrained.</li>
        <li>How the suspect was transported and the position of the suspect.</li>
        <li>Observations of the suspect's behavior and any signs of physiological problems.</li>
        <li>Any known or suspected drug use or other medical problems.</li>
    </ol>

            <div class="chapter" id="308">
    <h2>308 - Control Devices</h2>
    <h3>308.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>This policy provides guidelines for the use and maintenance of control devices that are described in this policy.</p>

    <h3>308.2 POLICY</h3>
    <p>In order to control subjects who are violent or who demonstrate the intent to be violent, the Metro Transit Police Department authorizes officers to use control devices in accordance with the guidelines in this policy and the Use of Force Policy.</p>

    <h3>308.3 ISSUING, CARRYING AND USING CONTROL DEVICES</h3>
    <p>Control devices described in this policy may be carried and used by members of this department only if the device has been issued by the Department or approved by the Chief of Police or the authorized designee.</p>
    <p>Only officers who have successfully completed department-approved training in the use of any control device are authorized to carry and use the device.</p>
    <p>Control devices may be used when a decision has been made to control, restrain or arrest a subject who is violent or who demonstrates the intent to be violent, and the use of the device appears reasonable under the circumstances. When reasonable, a verbal warning and opportunity to comply should precede the use of these devices.</p>
    <p>When using control devices, officers should carefully consider potential impact areas in order to minimize injuries and unintentional targets.</p>

    <h3>308.4 RESPONSIBILITIES</h3>
    <h4>308.4.1 SHIFT SUPERVISOR RESPONSIBILITIES</h4>
    <p>The Shift Supervisor may authorize the use of a control device by selected personnel or members of specialized units who have successfully completed the required training.</p>
    <h4>308.4.2 ARMORER RESPONSIBILITIES</h4>
    <p>The Training Coordinator shall control the inventory and issuance of all Department-issued control devices and shall ensure that all damaged, inoperative, outdated or expended control devices or munitions are properly disposed of, repaired or replaced.</p>
    <p>Every control device will be periodically inspected by the Training Coordinator or the designated instructor for a particular control device. The inspection shall be documented.</p>
    <h4>308.4.3 USER RESPONSIBILITIES</h4>
    <p>All normal maintenance, charging or cleaning shall remain the responsibility of personnel using the various devices.</p>
    <p>Any damaged, inoperative, outdated or expended control devices or munitions, along with documentation explaining the cause of the damage, shall be returned to the Training Coordinator for disposition. Damage to Department-issued property shall be documented and forwarded through the chain of command, when appropriate, explaining the cause of damage.</p>

    <h3>308.5 BATON GUIDELINES</h3>
    <p>The need to immediately control a suspect must be weighed against the risk of causing serious injury. The head, neck, throat, spine, heart, kidneys and groin should not be intentionally targeted except when the officer reasonably believes the suspect poses an imminent threat of serious bodily injury or death to the officer or others. Strikes to the above listed areas are considered deadly force.</p>
    <p>When carrying a baton, uniformed personnel shall carry the baton in its authorized holder on the equipment belt. Plainclothes and non-field personnel may carry the baton as authorized and in accordance with the needs of their assignment or at the direction of their supervisor.</p>

    <h3>308.6 TEAR GAS GUIDELINES</h3>
    <p>Tear gas may be used for crowd control, crowd dispersal or against barricaded suspects based on the circumstances. Only the Shift Supervisor, Incident Commander or Crisis Response Unit Commander may authorize the delivery and use of tear gas, and only after evaluating all conditions known at the time and determining that such force reasonably appears justified and necessary.</p>
    <p>When practicable, fire personnel should be alerted or summoned to the scene prior to the deployment of tear gas to control any fires and to assist in providing medical aid or gas evacuation if needed.</p>

    <h3>308.7 OLEORESIN CAPSICUM (OC) GUIDELINES</h3>
    <p>As with other control devices, oleoresin capsicum (OC) spray and pepper projectiles may be considered for use to bring under control an individual or groups of individuals who are engaging in, or are about to engage in violent behavior. Pepper projectiles and OC spray should not be used against individuals or groups who merely fail to disperse or do not reasonably appear to present a risk to the safety of officers or the public (i.e. passively resisting individuals or groups).</p>
    <h4>308.7.1 OC SPRAY</h4>
    <p>Uniformed personnel carrying OC spray shall carry the device in its holster on the equipment belt. Plainclothes and non-field personnel may carry OC spray as authorized, in accordance with the needs of their assignment or at the direction of their supervisor.</p>
    <h4>308.7.2 PEPPER PROJECTILE SYSTEMS</h4>
    <p>Pepper projectiles are plastic spheres that are filled with a derivative of OC powder. Because the compressed gas launcher delivers the projectiles with enough force to burst the projectiles on impact and release the OC powder, the potential exists for the projectiles to inflict injury if they strike the head, neck, spine or groin. Therefore, personnel deploying a pepper projectile</p>
    <p>system should not intentionally target those areas, except when the officer reasonably believes the suspect poses an imminent threat of serious bodily injury or death to the officer or others.</p>
    <p>Officers encountering a situation that warrants the use of a pepper projectile system shall notify a supervisor as soon as practicable. A supervisor shall respond to all pepper projectile system incidents where the suspect has been hit or exposed to the chemical agent. The supervisor shall ensure that all notifications and reports are completed as required by the Use of Force Policy.</p>
    <p>Each deployment of a pepper projectile system shall be documented. This includes situations where the launcher was directed toward the suspect, whether or not the launcher was used. Unintentional discharges shall be promptly reported to a supervisor and documented on the appropriate report form. Only non-incident use of a pepper projectile system, such as training and product demonstrations, is exempt from the reporting requirement.</p>
    <h4>308.7.3 TREATMENT FOR OC SPRAY EXPOSURE</h4>
    <p>Persons who have been sprayed with or otherwise affected by the use of OC should be promptly provided with medical attention (e.g. fresh air, seated upright, cool water etc) to address the affected areas. Those persons who complain of further severe effects shall be examined by appropriate medical personnel.</p>

    <h3>308.8 POST-APPLICATION NOTICE</h3>
    <p>Whenever tear gas or OC has been introduced into a residence, building interior, vehicle or other enclosed area, officers should provide the owners or available occupants with notice of the possible presence of residue that could result in irritation or injury if the area is not properly cleaned. Such notice should include advisement that clean up will be at the owner’s expense. Information regarding the method of notice and the individuals notified should be included in related reports.</p>

    <h3>308.9 KINETIC ENERGY PROJECTILE GUIDELINES</h3>
    <p>This department is committed to reducing the potential for violent confrontations. Kinetic energy projectiles, when used properly, are less likely to result in death or serious physical injury and can be used in an attempt to de-escalate a potentially deadly situation.</p>
    <h4>308.9.1 DEPLOYMENT AND USE</h4>
    <p>Only department-approved kinetic energy munitions shall be carried and deployed. Approved munitions may be used to compel an individual to cease his/her actions when such munitions present a reasonable option.</p>
    <p>Officers are not required or compelled to use approved munitions in lieu of other reasonable tactics if the involved officer determines that deployment of these munitions cannot be done safely. The safety of hostages, innocent persons and officers takes priority over the safety of subjects engaged in criminal or suicidal behavior.</p>
    <p>Circumstances appropriate for deployment include, but are not limited to, situations in which:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>The suspect is armed with a weapon and the tactical circumstances allow for the safe application of approved munitions.</li>
        <li>The suspect has made credible threats to harm him/herself or others.</li>
        <li>The suspect is engaged in riotous behavior or is throwing rocks, bottles or other dangerous projectiles at people and/or officers.</li>
        <li>There is probable cause to believe that the suspect has already committed a crime of violence and is refusing to comply with lawful orders.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>308.9.2 DEPLOYMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h4>
    <p>Before discharging projectiles, the officer should consider such factors as:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Distance and angle to target.</li>
        <li>Type of munitions employed.</li>
        <li>Type and thickness of subject’s clothing.</li>
        <li>The subject’s proximity to others.</li>
        <li>The location of the subject.</li>
        <li>Whether the subject’s actions dictate the need for an immediate response and the use of control devices appears appropriate.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>A verbal warning of the intended use of the device should precede its application, unless it would otherwise endanger the safety of officers or when it is not practicable due to the circumstances. The purpose of the warning is to give the individual a reasonable opportunity to voluntarily comply and to warn other officers and individuals that the device is being deployed.</p>
    <p>Officers should keep in mind the manufacturer’s recommendations and their training regarding effective distances and target areas. However, officers are not restricted solely to use according to manufacturer recommendations. Each situation must be evaluated on the totality of circumstances at the time of deployment.</p>
    <p>The need to immediately incapacitate the subject must be weighed against the risk of causing serious injury or death. The head and neck should not be intentionally targeted, except when the officer reasonably believes the suspect poses an imminent threat of serious bodily injury or death to the officer or others.</p>
    <h4>308.9.3 SAFETY PROCEDURES</h4>
    <p>Shotguns specifically designated for use with kinetic energy projectiles will be specially marked in a manner that makes them readily identifiable as such.</p>
    <p>Officers will inspect the shotgun and projectiles at the beginning of each shift to ensure that the shotgun is in proper working order and the projectiles are of the approved type and appear to be free from defects.</p>
    <p>When it is not deployed, the shotgun will be unloaded and properly and securely stored in the vehicle. When deploying the kinetic energy projectile shotgun, the officer shall visually inspect the kinetic energy projectiles to ensure that conventional ammunition is not being loaded into the shotgun.</p>
    <p>Absent compelling circumstances, officers who must transition from conventional ammunition to kinetic energy projectiles will employ the two-person rule for loading. The two-person rule is a safety measure in which a second officer watches the unloading and loading process to ensure that the weapon is completely emptied of conventional ammunition.</p>

    <h3>308.10 TRAINING FOR CONTROL DEVICES</h3>
    <p>The Training Coordinator shall ensure that all personnel who are authorized to carry a control device have been properly trained and certified to carry the specific control device and are re- trained or re-certified as necessary.</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Proficiency training shall be monitored and documented by a certified, control-device weapons or tactics instructor.</li>
        <li>All training and proficiency for control devices will be documented in the officer's training file.</li>
        <li>Officers who fail to demonstrate proficiency with the control device or knowledge of this agency's Use of Force Policy will be provided remedial training. If an officer cannot demonstrate proficiency with a control device or knowledge of this agency's Use of Force Policy after remedial training, the officer will be restricted from carrying the control device and may be subject to discipline.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>308.11 REPORTING USE OF CONTROL DEVICES AND TECHNIQUES</h3>
    <p>Any application of a control device or technique listed in this policy shall be documented in the related incident report and reported pursuant to the Use of Force Policy.</p>
</div>

            <div class="chapter" id="309">
    <h2>309 - Conducted Energy Device</h2>
    <h3>309.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>This policy provides guidelines for the issuance and use of the Conducted Energy Device (CED).</p>

    <h3>309.2 POLICY</h3>
    <p>The TASER device is intended to control a violent or potentially violent individual, while minimizing the risk of serious injury. The appropriate use of such a device should result in fewer serious injuries to officers and suspects.</p>

    <h3>309.3 ISSUANCE AND CARRYING TASER DEVICES</h3>
    <p>Only members who have successfully completed department-approved training may be issued and carry the TASER device.</p>
    <p>TASER devices are issued for use during a member's current assignment. Those leaving a particular assignment may be required to return the device to the department's inventory.</p>
    <p>Officers shall only use the TASER device and cartridges that have been issued by the Department. Uniformed officers who have been issued the TASER device shall wear the device in an approved holster on their person. Non-uniformed officers may secure the TASER device in the driver's compartment of their vehicle.</p>
    <p>Members carrying the TASER device should perform a spark test on the unit prior to every shift.</p>
    <p>When carried while in uniform, officers shall carry the TASER device in a weak-side holster on the side opposite the duty weapon.</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>All TASER devices shall be clearly and distinctly marked to differentiate them from the duty weapon and any other device.</li>
        <li>Whenever practicable, officers should carry two or more cartridges on their person when carrying the TASER device.</li>
        <li>Officers shall be responsible for ensuring that their issued TASER device is properly maintained and in good working order.</li>
        <li>Officers should not hold both a firearm and the TASER device at the same time.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>309.4 VERBAL AND VISUAL WARNINGS</h3>
    <p>A verbal warning of the intended use of the TASER device should precede its application, unless it would otherwise endanger the safety of officers or when it is not practicable due to the circumstances. The purpose of the warning is to:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Provide the individual with a reasonable opportunity to voluntarily comply.</li>
        <li>Provide other officers and individuals with a warning that the TASER device may be deployed.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If, after a verbal warning, an individual is unwilling to voluntarily comply with an officer's lawful orders and it appears both reasonable and feasible under the circumstances, the officer may, but is not required to, display the electrical arc (provided that a cartridge has not been loaded into the device), or the laser in a further attempt to gain compliance prior to the application of the TASER device. The aiming laser should never be intentionally directed into the eyes of another as it may permanently impair his/her vision.</p>
    <p>The fact that a verbal or other warning was given or the reasons it was not given shall be documented by the officer deploying the TASER device in the related report.</p>

    <h3>309.5 DOCUMENTATION</h3>
    <p>Officers shall document all TASER device discharges in the related arrest/crime report and the TASER device report form. Notification shall also be made to a supervisor in compliance with the Use of Force Policy. Unintentional discharges, pointing the device at a person, laser activation and arcing the device will also be documented on the report form.</p>
    <h4>309.5.1 TASER DEVICE FORM</h4>
    <p>Items that shall be included in the TASER device report form are:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>The type and brand of TASER device and cartridge and cartridge serial number.</li>
        <li>Date, time and location of the incident.</li>
        <li>Whether any display, laser or arc deterred a subject and gained compliance.</li>
        <li>The number of TASER device activations, the duration of each cycle, the duration between activations, and (as best as can be determined) the duration that the subject received applications.</li>
        <li>The range at which the TASER device was used.</li>

    <h3>309.6 MEDICAL TREATMENT</h3>
    <p>Metro Transit Police Department officers may carefully remove TASER device darts from a person's body following routine application of the TASER device. Used TASER device probes shall be treated as a sharps biohazard, similar to a used hypodermic needle, and handled appropriately. Universal precautions should be taken.</p>
    <p>All persons who have been struck by TASER device probes or who have been subjected to the electric discharge of the device shall be medically assessed prior to booking. Additionally, any such individual who falls under any of the following categories should, as soon as practicable, be examined by paramedics or other qualified medical personnel:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>The person is suspected of being under the influence of controlled substances and/or alcohol.</li>
        <li>The person may be pregnant.</li>
        <li>The person reasonably appears to be in need of medical attention.</li>

        <li>The person requests medical treatment.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Any individual exhibiting signs of distress or who is exposed to multiple or prolonged applications (i.e., more than 15 seconds) shall be transported to a medical facility for examination or medically evaluated prior to booking. If any individual refuses medical attention, such a refusal should be witnessed by another officer and/or medical personnel and shall be fully documented in related</p>
    <p>reports. If an audio recording is made of the contact or an interview with the individual, any refusal should be included, if possible.</p>
    <p>The transporting officer shall inform any person providing medical care or receiving custody that the individual has been subjected to the application of the TASER device.</p>

    <h3>309.7 SUPERVISOR RESPONSIBILITIES</h3>
    <p>A supervisor should review each incident where a person has been exposed to an activation of the TASER device. The supervisor shall complete a supplement under the related case report.</p>

    <h3>309.8 TRAINING</h3>
    <p>Personnel who are authorized to carry the TASER device shall be permitted to do so only after successfully completing the initial department-approved training.

    <p>Proficiency training for personnel who have been issued TASER devices should occur every year. A reassessment of an officer's knowledge and/or practical skill may be required at any time if deemed appropriate by the Training Coordinator. All training and proficiency for TASER devices will be documented in the officer's training file.</p>
    <p>Command staff, supervisors and investigators should receive TASER device training as appropriate for the investigations they conduct and review.</p>
    <p>Officers who do not carry TASER devices should receive training that is sufficient to familiarize them with the device and with working with officers who use the device.</p>
    <p>The Training Coordinator is responsible for ensuring that all members who carry TASER devices have received initial and annual proficiency training. Periodic audits should be used for verification.</p>
    <p>Application of TASER devices during training could result in injury to personnel and should not be mandatory for certification.</p>
    <p>The Training Coordinator should ensure that all training includes:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>A review of this policy.</li>
        <li>A review of the Use of Force Policy.</li>
        <li>Performing weak-hand draws or cross-draws to reduce the possibility of accidentally drawing and firing a firearm.</li>

    <h2>310 - Officer-Involved Shooting and Deaths</h2>
    <h3>310.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this policy is to establish policy and procedures for the investigation of an incident in which a person is injured or dies as the result of an officer-involved shooting or dies as a result of other action of an officer.</p>
    <p>In other incidents not covered by this policy, the Chief of Police may decide that the investigation will follow the process provided in this policy.</p>
    <h4>310.1.1 DEFINITIONS</h4>
    <p><strong>Critical Incident</strong> - An incident involving any of the following situations occurring in the line of duty:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>The use of Deadly Force by or against a Metro Transit Police Officer.</li>
        <li>Death or Great Bodily Harm to a Metro Transit Police Officer.</li>
        <li>Death or Great Bodily Harm to a person who is in the custody or control of a Metro Transit Police Officer.</li>
        <li>Any action by a Metro Transit Police Officer that causes or is intended to cause Death or Great Bodily Harm.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Deadly Force</strong> - Force which the actor uses with the purpose of causing, or which the actor should reasonably know creates a substantial risk of causing, death or great bodily harm. The intentional discharge of a firearm, other than a firearm loaded with less lethal munitions and used by a peace officer within the scope of official duties, in the direction of another person, or at a vehicle in which another person is believed to be, constitutes deadly force. "Less lethal munitions" means projectiles which are designed to stun, temporarily incapacitate, or cause temporary discomfort to a person. (Minn. Stat. § 609.066 Subd. 1).</p>
    <p><strong>Great Bodily Harm</strong> - Bodily injury which creates a high probability of death, or which causes serious permanent disfigurement, or which causes a permanent or protracted loss or impairment of the function of any bodily member or organ or other serious bodily harm. (Minn. Stat. § 609.02 Subd. 8).</p>

    <h3>310.2 TYPES OF INVESTIGATIONS</h2>
    <p>Officer-involved shootings and deaths involve several separate investigations. The investigations may include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A criminal investigation of the suspect’s actions.</li>
        <li>A criminal investigation of the involved officer’s actions.</li>
        <li>An administrative investigation as to policy compliance by involved officers.</li>
        <li>A civil investigation to determine potential liability.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>310.3 CONTROL OF INVESTIGATIONS</h3>
    <p>Investigators from surrounding agencies may be assigned to work on the criminal investigation of officer-involved shootings and deaths. This may include at least one investigator from the agency that employs the involved officer.</p>
    <p>Jurisdiction is determined by the location of the shooting or death and the agency employing the involved officer. The following scenarios outline the jurisdictional responsibilities for investigating officer-involved shootings and deaths.</p>
    <h4>310.3.1 CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION OF SUSPECT ACTIONS</h4>
    <p>The investigation of any possible criminal conduct by the suspect is controlled by the agency in whose jurisdiction the suspect’s crime occurred. For example, the Minneapolis Police Department would control the investigation if the suspect’s crime occurred in the City of Minneapolis .</p>
    <p>If multiple crimes have been committed in multiple jurisdictions, identification of the agency that will control the investigation may be reached in the same way as with any other crime. The investigation may be conducted by the agency in control of the criminal investigation of the involved officer, at the discretion of the Chief of Police and with concurrence from the other agency.</p>
    <h4>310.3.2 POST ADMINISTRATIVE INVESTIGATIONS</h4>
    <p>The Minnesota POST Board may require an administrative investigation based on a complaint alleging a violation of a statute or rule that the board is empowered to enforce. An officer-involved shooting may result in such an allegation. Any such complaint assigned to this department shall be completed and a written summary submitted to the POST executive director within 30 days of the order for inquiry (Minn. Stat. § 214.10 Subd. 10).</p>

    <h3>310.4 INVESTIGATION PROCESS</h3>
    <p>The following procedures are guidelines used in the investigation of an officer-involved shooting or death:</p>
    <h4>310.4.1 UNINVOLVED OFFICER RESPONSIBILITIES</h4>
    <p>Upon arrival at the scene of an officer-involved shooting or death, the first uninvolved MTPD officer will be the officer-in-charge and will assume the responsibilities of a supervisor until properly relieved. This officer should, as appropriate:</p>

    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Attempt to obtain a brief overview of the situation from any uninvolved officers.</p>
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>In the event that there are no uninvolved officers who can supply adequate overview, the supervisor should attempt to obtain a brief voluntary overview from one involved officer.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>If necessary, the supervisor may administratively order any MTPD officer to immediately provide public safety information necessary to secure the scene, identify injured parties and pursue suspects.
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>Public safety information shall be limited to such things as outstanding suspect information, number and direction of any shots fired, perimeter of the incident scene, identity of known or potential witnesses and any other pertinent information.</li>
                <li>The initial on-scene supervisor should not attempt to order any involved officer to provide any information other than public safety information.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Provide all available information to the Shift Supervisor and Transit Control Center. If feasible, sensitive information should be communicated over secure networks.</li>
        <li>Take command of and secure the incident scene with additional MTPD members until properly relieved by another supervisor or other assigned personnel or investigator.</li>
        <li>As soon as practicable, ensure that involved officers are transported (separately, if feasible) to a suitable location for further direction.
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>Each involved MTPD officer should be given an administrative order not to discuss the incident with other involved officers or MTPD members pending further direction from a supervisor.</li>
                <li>When an involved officer’s weapon is taken or left at the scene for other than officer- safety reasons (e.g., evidence), ensure that he/she is provided with a comparable replacement weapon or transported by other officers.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>310.4.3 SHIFT SUPERVISOR RESPONSIBILITIES</h4>
    <p>Upon learning of an officer-involved shooting or death, the Shift Supervisor shall be responsible for coordinating all aspects of the incident until he/she is relieved by the Chief of Police, Deputy Chief of Police or a Captain.</p>

    <h4>310.4.5 INVOLVED OFFICERS</h4>
    <p>The following shall be considered for the involved officer:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Any request for legal or union representation will be accommodated.</p>
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>Involved MTPD officers shall not be permitted to meet collectively or in a group with an attorney or any representative prior to providing a formal interview or report.</li>
                <li>Requests from involved non-MTPD officers should be referred to their employing agency.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Discussions with licensed attorneys will be considered privileged as attorney-client communications.</li>

            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>Interviews with a licensed psychotherapist will be considered privileged.</li>
                <li>An interview or session with a licensed psychotherapist may take place prior to the member providing a formal interview or report. However, involved members shall not be permitted to consult or meet collectively or in a group with a licensed psychotherapist prior to providing a formal interview or report.</li>
                <li>A separate fitness-for-duty exam may also be required (see the Fitness for Duty Policy).</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Communications with peer counselors are privileged and shall not be disclosed without the permission of the involved officer. The peer counselor, however, may disclose information that he/she reasonably believes indicates that the officer may be a danger to self or others, as long as the information is used only for the purpose of eliminating the danger. Such</li>
    </ol>
    <p>information or opinion is not admissible in any personnel or occupational licensing matter involving the officer (Minn. Stat. § 181.973).</p>
    <p>Care should be taken to preserve the integrity of any physical evidence present on the involved officer's equipment or clothing, such as blood or fingerprints, until investigators or lab personnel can properly retrieve it.</p>
    <p>Each involved MTPD officer shall be given reasonable paid administrative leave following an officer-involved shooting or death. In most cases, a minimum of three days and a maximum of seven days shall be considered as reasonable. The Chief of Police must approve paid administrative leave time extending beyond the seven day maximum. It shall be the responsibility of the Shift Supervisor to make schedule adjustments to accommodate such leave.</p>
    <h4>310.4.6 MONITORING OFFICERS The monitoring officer(s) shall:</h4>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Assume control of the involved officer as directed by the on-scene supervisor.</li>
        <li>Bring the involved officer to a department vehicle and accompany the involved officer to the police department or the location determined by the supervisor.</li>
        <li>The monitoring officer shall check in with the Investigations Supervisor or his/her designee once at the determined location.</li>
        <li>Remain with the involved officer at the determined location until advised by the Investigations Supervisor that you are relieved of that duty.</li>
        <li>The monitoring officer will allow a union representative or designee access to the involved officer(s) until a formal statement is given or legal counsel is present. This access shall be continually monitored to ensure that details of the investigation are not discussed with anyone other than legal counsel and/or the involved officer's union representative.</li>
        <li>The monitoring officer will write a report detailing his/her actions, including who had access to the involved officer, length of time of the contact and specifically document whether the involved officer spoke with anyone about the incident while in his/her company.</li>
        <li>Upon request of the involved officer(s), ensure that the involved officer(s) is afforded the opportunity to meet with legal counsel in a confidential setting.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>310.5  CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION</h4>
    <p>This Department will utilize the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) to conduct an independent criminal investigation into the circumstances of any officer-involved shooting or death.</p>
    <p>If available, investigative personnel from this departmentoffice may be assigned to partner with investigators from outside agencies or the DistrictCountyAttorney's Office to avoid duplicating efforts in related criminal investigations.</p>
    <p>Once public safety issues have been addressed, criminal investigators should be given the opportunity to obtain a voluntary statement from involved officers and to complete their interviews. The following shall be considered for the involved officer:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>agencyAcronym supervisors and InternalAffairsUnit / Internal Affairs Unit personnel should not participate directly in any voluntary interview of agencyAcronym officers. This will not prohibit such personnel from monitoring interviews or providing the criminal investigators with topics for inquiry.</li>
        <li>If requested, any involved officer will be afforded the opportunity to consult individually with a representative of his/her choosing or an attorney prior to speaking with criminal investigators. However, in order to maintain the integrity of each involved officer’s statement, involved officers shall not consult or meet with a representative or an attorney collectively or in groups prior to being interviewed.</li>
        <li>If any involved officer is physically, emotionally or otherwise not in a position to provide a voluntary statement when interviewed by criminal investigators, consideration should be given to allowing a reasonable period for the officer to schedule an alternate time for the interview.</li>
        <li>Any voluntary statement provided by an involved officer will be made available for inclusion in any related investigation, including administrative investigations. However, no administratively coerced statement will be provided to any criminal investigators unless the officer consents.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>310.5.1 REPORTS BY INVOLVED MTPD OFFICERS</h4>
    <p>In the event that suspects remain outstanding or subject to prosecution for related offenses, this department shall retain the authority to require involved MTPD officers to provide sufficient information for related criminal reports to facilitate the apprehension and prosecution of those individuals.</p>
    <p>While the involved MTPD officer may write the report, it is generally recommended that such reports be completed by assigned investigators, who should interview all involved officers as victims/witnesses. Since the purpose of these reports will be to facilitate criminal prosecution, statements of involved officers should focus on evidence to establish the elements of criminal activities by suspects. Care should be taken not to duplicate information provided by involved officers in other reports.</p>
    <p>Nothing in this section shall be construed to deprive an involved MTPD officer of the right to consult with legal counsel prior to completing any such criminal report.</p>
    <p>Reports related to the prosecution of criminal suspects will be processed according to normal procedures but should also be included for reference in the investigation of the officer-involved shooting or death.</p>
    <h4>310.5.2 WITNESS IDENTIFICATION AND INTERVIEWS</h4>
    <p>Because potential witnesses to an officer-involved shooting or death may become unavailable or the integrity of their statements compromised with the passage of time, a supervisor should</p>
    <p>take reasonable steps to promptly coordinate with criminal investigators to utilize available law enforcement personnel for the following:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Identification of all persons present at the scene and in the immediate area.
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>When feasible, a recorded statement should be obtained from those persons who claim not to have witnessed the incident but who were present at the time it occurred.
                </li>
                <li>Any potential witness who is unwilling or unable to remain available for a formal interview should not be detained absent reasonable suspicion to detain or probable cause to arrest. Without detaining the individual for the sole purpose of identification, attempts to identify the witness prior to his/her departure should be made whenever feasible.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Witnesses who are willing to provide a formal interview should be asked to meet at a suitable location where criminal investigators may obtain a recorded statement. Such witnesses, if willing, may be transported by a member of the Department.
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>A written, verbal or recorded statement of consent should be obtained prior to transporting a witness. When the witness is a minor, consent should be obtained from the parent or guardian, if available, prior to transportation.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Promptly contacting the suspect’s known family and associates to obtain any available and untainted background information about the suspect’s activities and state of mind prior to the incident.</p>
    <h4>310.5.3 INVESTIGATIVE PERSONNEL</h4>
    <p>Once notified of an officer-involved shooting or death, it shall be the responsibility of the designated Investigation Division supervisor to assign appropriate investigative personnel to handle the investigation of related crimes. Department investigators will be assigned to work with investigators from the outside agency and may be assigned to separately handle the investigation of any related crimes not being investigated by the outside agency.</p>
    <p>All related department reports, except administrative and/or privileged reports, will be forwarded to the designated Investigation Division supervisor for approval. Privileged reports shall be maintained exclusively by members who are authorized such access. Administrative reports will be forwarded to the appropriate Supervisor .</p>

    <h3>310.6 ADMINISTRATIVE INVESTIGATION</h3>
    <p>In addition to all other investigations associated with an officer-involved shooting or death, this department will conduct an internal administrative investigation of involved MTPD officers to determine conformance with department policy. This investigation will be conducted under the supervision of the Professional Standards Unit / Internal Affairs Unit and will be considered a confidential officer personnel file.</p>
    <p>Interviews of members shall be subject to department policies and applicable laws (Personnel Complaints Policy; Minn. Stat. § 626.89).</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Any officer involved in a shooting or death may be requested or administratively compelled to provide a blood sample for alcohol/drug screening in accordance with the drug and alcohol testing guidelines in the Drug and Alcohol-Free Workplace Policy adopted under the authority of Minn. Stat. § 181.950 to Minn. Stat. § 181.957. Absent consent from the officer, such compelled samples and the results of any such testing shall not be disclosed to any criminal investigative agency.</li>
        <li>If any officer has voluntarily elected to provide a statement to criminal investigators, the assigned administrative investigator should review that statement before proceeding with any further interview of that involved officer.
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>If a further interview of the officer is deemed necessary to determine policy compliance, care should be taken to limit the inquiry to new areas with minimal, if any, duplication of questions addressed in the voluntary statement. The involved officer shall be provided with a copy of his/her prior statement before proceeding with any subsequent interviews.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>In the event that an involved officer has elected not to provide criminal investigators with a voluntary statement, the assigned administrative investigator shall conduct an administrative interview to determine all relevant information .
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>Although this interview should not be unreasonably delayed, care should be taken to ensure that the officer’s physical and psychological needs have been addressed before commencing the interview.</li>
                <li>The interview must be taken at the MTPD or at a place agreed to by the interviewer and the involved officer.</li>
                <li>The interview must be of reasonable duration and provide the involved officer reasonable periods for rest and personal necessities. When practicable, the interview must be held during the involved officer’s regularly scheduled work shift. If not, the involved officer must be compensated at his/her current pay rate.</li>
                <li>If requested, the officer shall have the opportunity to select an uninvolved representative or an attorney, or both, to be present during the interview. However, in order to maintain the integrity of each individual officer’s statement, involved officers shall not consult or meet with a representative collectively or in groups prior to being interviewed.</li>
                <li>Administrative interviews shall be recorded electronically or otherwise by the investigator. The officer may also record the interview. A complete copy or transcript of the interview must be provided to the involved officer upon written request without charge or undue delay.</li>
                <li>The officer shall be informed of the nature of the investigation. If an officer refuses to answer questions, he/she should be given his/her Garrity rights and ordered to provide full and truthful answers to all questions. The officer shall be informed in writing or on the record that the interview will be for administrative purposes only and that the statement cannot be used criminally.</li>
                <li>The Professional Standards Unit / Internal Affairs Unit shall compile all relevant information and reports necessary for the Department to determine compliance with applicable policies.</li>
                <li>Regardless of whether the use of force is an issue in the case, the completed administrative investigation shall be submitted to the Use of Force Review Board, which will restrict its findings as to whether there was compliance with the Use of Force Policy.</li>
                <li>Any other indications of potential policy violations shall be determined in accordance with standard disciplinary procedures.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>310.7 CIVIL LIABILITY RESPONSE</h3>
    <p>A member of this department may be assigned to work exclusively under the direction of the legal counsel for the Department to assist in the preparation of materials deemed necessary in anticipation of potential civil litigation.</p>
    <p>All materials generated in this capacity shall be considered attorney work product and may not be used for any other purpose. The civil liability response is not intended to interfere with any other investigation but shall be given reasonable access to all other investigations.</p>

    <h3>310.8 AUDIO AND VIDEO RECORDINGS</h3>
    <p>Any officer involved in a shooting or death may be permitted to review available Mobile Audio/ Video (MAV), body-worn video, or other video or audio recordings prior to providing a recorded statement or completing reports.</p>
    <p>Upon request, non-law enforcement witnesses who are able to verify their presence and their ability to contemporaneously perceive events at the scene of an incident may also be permitted to review available MAV, body-worn video, or other video or audio recordings with the approval of assigned investigators or a supervisor.</p>
    <p>Any MAV, body-worn and other known video or audio recordings of an incident should not be publicly released during an ongoing investigation without consulting the prosecuting attorney or Prosecuting Attorney’s Office, as appropriate.</p>

    <h3>310.9 DEBRIEFING</h3>
    <p>Following an officer-involved shooting or death, the Metro Transit Police Department should conduct both a critical incident/stress debriefing and a tactical debriefing.</p>
    <h4>310.9.1 CRITICAL INCIDENT/STRESS DEBRIEFING</h4>
    <p>A critical incident/stress debriefing should occur as soon as practicable. The Patrol Captain is responsible for organizing the debriefing. Notes and recorded statements should not be taken because the sole purpose of the debriefing is to help mitigate the stress-related effects of a traumatic event (Minn. Stat. § 181.973).</p>
    <p>The debriefing is not part of any investigative process. Care should be taken not to release or repeat any communication made during a debriefing unless otherwise authorized by policy, law or a valid court order.</p>
    <p>Attendance at the debriefing shall only include those members of the Department directly involved in the incident, which can include support personnel (e.g., dispatchers, other non-sworn). Family or other support personnel may attend with the concurrence of those involved in the incident. The debriefing shall be closed to the public and should be closed to all other members of the Department, including supervisory and Professional Standards Unit / Internal Affairs Unit personnel.</p>
    <h4>310.9.2 TACTICAL DEBRIEFING</h4>
    <p>A tactical debriefing should take place to identify any training or areas of policy that need improvement. The Chief of Police should identify the appropriate participants. This debriefing should not be conducted until all involved members have provided recorded or formal statements to criminal and/or administrative investigators.</p>

    <h3>310.10 MEDIA RELATIONS</h3>
    <p>Any media release shall be prepared with input and concurrence from the supervisor and department representative responsible for each phase of the investigation. Releases will be available to the Chief of Police or designee and Public Information Officer in the event of inquiries from the media.</p>
    <p>No involved MTPD officer shall make any comment to the media unless he/she is authorized by the Chief of Police or designee.</p>
    <p>Department members receiving inquiries regarding officer-involved shootings or deaths occurring in other jurisdictions shall refrain from public comment and will direct those inquiries to the agency having jurisdiction and primary responsibility for the investigation.</p>

    <h3>310.11 REPORTING</h3>
    <p>If an officer discharges a firearm in the course of duty, the Chief of Police shall notify the Commissioner of Public Safety within 30 days of the reason for and the circumstances surrounding the discharge of the firearm (Minn. Stat.§ 626.553).</p>

This exclusion does not apply to the carrying of a single folding pocketknife that is not otherwise prohibited by law.</p>
    <h4>312.3.1 HANDGUNS</h4>
    <p>The authorized department-issued handgun is the Glock 17.</p>
    <p>The following additional handguns are approved for on-duty use by part-time sworn officers:</p>

    <p>The carrying of firearms by members while off-duty is permitted by the Chief of Police but may be rescinded should circumstances dictate (e.g., administrative leave). Members who choose to carry a firearm while off-duty, based on their authority as peace officers, will be required to meet the following guidelines:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>A personally owned firearm shall be used, carried and inspected in accordance with the Personally Owned Firearms requirements in this policy.
            <ol>
                <li>The purchase of the personally owned firearm and ammunition shall be the responsibility of the member.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>The firearm shall be carried concealed at all times and in such a manner as to prevent unintentional cocking, discharge or loss of physical control.</li>

        <li>Prior to carrying any off-duty firearm, the member shall demonstrate to the Armorer that he/ she is proficient in handling and firing the firearm and that it will be carried in a safe manner.</li>
        <li>The member will successfully qualify with the firearm prior to it being carried.</li>
        <li>Members shall provide written notice of the make, model, color, serial number and caliber of the firearm to the Armorer, who will maintain a list of the information.</li>
        <li>If a member desires to use more than one firearm while off-duty, he/she may do so, as long as all requirements set forth in this policy for each firearm are met.</li>
        <li>Members shall only carry department-authorized ammunition</li>
        <li>When armed, officers shall carry their badges and Metro Transit Police Department identification cards under circumstances requiring possession of such identification.</li>
    </ol>

Replacements for unserviceable or depleted ammunition issued by the Department shall be dispensed by the Armorer when needed, in accordance with established policy.</p>
    <p>Members carrying personally owned authorized firearms of a caliber differing from department- issued firearms shall be responsible for obtaining fresh duty ammunition in accordance with the above, at their own expense. Replacements for unserviceable or depleted ammunition issued by the Department shall be dispensed by the Armorer when needed, in accordance with established policy.</p>

    <h3>312.4 EQUIPMENT</h3>
    <p>Firearms carried on- or off-duty shall be maintained in a clean, serviceable condition. Maintenance and repair of authorized personally owned firearms are the responsibility of the individual member.</p>
    <h4>312.4.1 REPAIRS OR MODIFICATIONS</h4>
    <p>Each member shall be responsible for promptly reporting any damage or malfunction of an assigned firearm to a supervisor or the Armorer.</p>
    <p>Firearms that are the property of the Department or personally owned firearms that are approved for department use may be repaired or modified only by a person who is department-approved</p>
    <p>and certified as an armorer or gunsmith in the repair of the specific firearm. Such modification or repair must be authorized in advance by the Armorer.</p>
    <p>Any repairs or modifications to the member’s personally owned firearm shall be done at his/her expense and must be approved by the Armorer.</p>

Once approved sights have been properly installed on any firearm, the member shall qualify with the firearm to ensure proper functionality and sighting of the firearm prior to carrying it.</p>
    <p>Except in an approved training situation, a member may only sight in on a target when the member would otherwise be justified in pointing a firearm at the target.</p>

    <h3>312.5 SAFE HANDLING, INSPECTION AND STORAGE</h3>
    <p>Members shall maintain the highest level of safety when handling firearms and shall consider the following:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Members shall not unnecessarily display or handle any firearm.</li>

If the firearm is the member’s primary duty firearm, a replacement firearm will be issued to the member until the duty firearm is serviceable.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>312.5.1 INSPECTION AND STORAGE</h4>
    <p>Handguns shall be inspected regularly and upon access or possession by another person. Rifles shall be inspected at the beginning of the shift by the member to whom the weapon is issued. The member shall ensure that the firearm is carried in the proper condition and loaded with approved ammunition. Inspection of the rifle shall be done while standing outside of the patrol vehicle. All firearms shall be pointed in a safe direction or into clearing barrels.</p>
    <p>Personally owned firearms may be safely stored in lockers at the end of the shift. Department- owned firearms shall be stored appropriately. Handguns may remain loaded if they are secured in an appropriate holster. Rifles shall be unloaded in a safe manner and then stored appropriately.</p>
    <h4>312.5.2 STORAGE AT HOME</h4>
    <p>Members shall ensure that all firearms and ammunition are locked and secured while in their homes, vehicles or any other area under their control, and in a manner that will keep them inaccessible to children and others who should not have access. Members shall not permit department-issued firearms to be handled by anyone not authorized by the Department to do so. Members should be aware that negligent storage of a firearm could result in civil and criminal liability (Minn. Stat. § 609.666; Minn. Stat. § 609.378).</p>
    <h4>312.5.3 ALCOHOL AND DRUGS</h4>
    <p>Firearms shall not be carried by any member, either on- or off-duty, who has consumed an amount of an alcoholic beverage, taken any drugs or medication, or has taken any combination thereof that would tend to adversely affect the member’s senses or judgment.</p>

    <h3>312.6 FIREARMS TRAINING AND QUALIFICATIONS</h3>
    <p>All members who carry a firearm while on-duty are required to successfully complete training with their duty firearms. In addition to regular training, all members will qualify at least annually with their duty firearms (Minn. Stat. § 626.8452). Members will qualify with off-duty and secondary firearms at least once a year. Training and qualifications must be on an approved range course.</p>
    <p>At least annually, all members carrying a firearm should receive practical training designed to simulate field situations including low-light shooting.</p>
    <h4>312.6.1 NON-CERTIFICATION OR NON-QUALIFICATION</h4>
    <p>If any member fails to meet minimum standards for firearms training or qualification for any reason, including injury, illness, duty status or scheduling conflict, that member shall submit a memorandum to his/her immediate supervisor prior to the end of the required training or qualification period.</p>
    <p>Those who fail to meet minimum standards or qualify on their first shooting attempt shall be provided remedial training and will be subject to the following requirements:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Additional range assignments may be scheduled to assist the member in demonstrating consistent firearm proficiency.</li>
        <li>Members shall be given credit for a range training or qualification when obtaining a qualifying score or meeting standards after remedial training.</li>
        <li>No range credit will be given for the following:
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>Unauthorized range make-up</li>
                <li>Failure to meet minimum standards or qualify after remedial training</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Members who repeatedly fail to meet minimum standards will be removed from field assignment and may be subject to disciplinary action.</p>

    <h3>312.7 FIREARM DISCHARGE</h3>
    <p>Except during training or recreational use, any member who discharges a firearm intentionally or unintentionally, on- or off-duty, shall make a verbal report to his/her supervisor as soon as circumstances permit. If the discharge results in injury or death to another person, additional statements and reports shall be made in accordance with the Officer-Involved Shootings and Deaths Policy. If a firearm was discharged as a use of force, the involved member shall adhere to the additional reporting requirements set forth in the Use of Force Policy.</p>
    <p>In all other cases, written reports shall be made as follows:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">

        <li>If off-duty at the time of the incident, a written report shall be submitted or recorded statement provided no later than the end of the next regularly scheduled shift, unless otherwise directed by a supervisor.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>312.7.1 DESTRUCTION OF ANIMALS</h4>
    <p>Members are authorized to use firearms to stop an animal in circumstances where the animal reasonably appears to pose an imminent threat to human safety and alternative methods are not reasonably available or would likely be ineffective.</p>
    <p>In circumstances where there is sufficient advance notice that a potentially dangerous animal may be encountered, department members should develop reasonable contingency plans for dealing with the animal (e.g., fire extinguisher, Taser® device, oleoresin capsicum (OC) spray, animal control officer). Nothing in this policy shall prohibit any member from shooting a dangerous animal if circumstances reasonably dictate that a contingency plan has failed or becomes impractical.</p>
    <h4>312.7.2 INJURED ANIMALS</h4>
    <p>With the approval of a supervisor, a member may euthanize an animal that is so badly injured that human compassion requires its removal from further suffering and where other dispositions are impractical.</p>
    <h4>312.7.3 WARNING AND OTHER SHOTS</h4>
    <p>Warning shots are prohibited. Shots fired for the purpose of summoning aid are discouraged and may not be discharged unless the member reasonably believes that they appear necessary, effective and reasonably safe.</p>
    <h4>312.7.4 REPORTING FIREARMS DISCHARGE</h4>
    <p>The Chief of Police shall notify the Commissioner of Public Safety within 30 days of an on-duty firearm discharge, except when the discharge is in the course of training or destruction of animals (described in this policy). The notification shall contain information concerning the reason for and circumstances surrounding the discharge (Minn. Stat. § 626.553).</p>

    <h3>312.8 ARMORER / FIREARMS INSTRUCTOR DUTIES</h3>
    <p>The range will be under the exclusive control of the Armorer / Firearms Instructor. All members attending will follow the directions of the Armorer. The Armorer will maintain a roster of all members attending the range and will submit the roster to the Training Supervisor after each range date. Failure of any member to sign in and out with the Armorer may result in non-participation or non- qualification.</p>
    <p>The range shall remain operational and accessible to department members during hours established by the Department.</p>
    <p>The Armorer has the responsibility of making periodic inspection, at least once a year, of all duty firearms carried by members of this department to verify proper operation. The Armorer has the authority to deem any department-issued or privately owned firearm unfit for service. The member will be responsible for all repairs to his/her personally owned firearm; it will not be returned to service until inspected and approved by the Armorer.</p>
    <p>The Armorer has the responsibility for ensuring each member meets the minimum requirements during training shoots and, on at least a yearly basis, can demonstrate proficiency in the care, cleaning and safety of all firearms the member is authorized to carry.</p>
    <p>The Armorer shall complete and submit to the Training Supervisor documentation of the courses provided. Documentation shall include the qualifications of each instructor who provides the training, a description of the training provided and, on a form that has been approved by the Department, a list of each member who completes the training. The Armorer should keep accurate records of all training shoots, qualifications, repairs, maintenance or other records as directed by the Training Supervisor.</p>

    <h3>312.9 FLYING WHILE ARMED</h3>
    <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has imposed rules governing law enforcement officers flying armed on commercial aircraft. The following requirements apply to personnel who intend to be armed while flying on a commercial air carrier or flights where screening is conducted (49 CFR 1544.219):</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Officers wishing to fly while armed must be flying in an official capacity, not for vacation or pleasure and must have a need to have the firearm accessible, as determined by the Department based on the law and published TSA rules.</li>
        <li>Officers must carry their Metro Transit Police Department identification card, bearing the officer's name, a full-face photograph, identification number, the officer's signature and the signature of the Chief of Police or the official seal of the Department and must present this identification to airline officials when requested. The officer should also carry the standard photo identification needed for passenger screening by airline and TSA officials (e.g., driver’s license, passport).</li>
        <li>The Metro Transit Police Department must submit a National Law Enforcement Telecommunications System (NLETS) message prior to the officer’s travel. If approved, TSA will send the Metro Transit Police Department an NLETS message containing a unique alphanumeric identifier. The officer must present the message on the day of travel to airport personnel as authorization to travel while armed.</li>
        <li>An official letter signed by the Chief of Police authorizing armed travel may also accompany the officer. The letter should outline the officer’s need to fly armed, detail his/her itinerary and include that the officer has completed the mandatory TSA training for a law enforcement officer flying while armed.</li>
        <li>Officers must have completed the mandated TSA security training covering officers flying while armed. The training shall be given by the department-appointed instructor.</li>
        <li>It is the officer’s responsibility to notify the air carrier in advance of the intended armed travel. This notification can be accomplished by early check-in at the carrier’s check-in counter.</li>
        <li>Any officer flying while armed should discreetly contact the flight crew prior to take-off and notify them of his/her assigned seat.</li>
        <li>Discretion must be used to avoid alarming passengers or crew by displaying a firearm. The officer must keep the firearm concealed on his/her person at all times. Firearms are not permitted in carry-on luggage and may not be stored in an overhead compartment.</li>
        <li>Officers should resolve any problems associated with flying armed through the flight captain, ground security manager, TSA representative or other management representative of the air carrier.</li>
        <li>Officers shall not consume alcoholic beverages while aboard an aircraft, or within eight hours prior to boarding an aircraft.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>312.10 CARRYING FIREARMS OUT OF STATE</h3>
    <p>Qualified, active, full-time officers of this department are authorized to carry a concealed firearm in all other states subject to the following conditions (18 USC § 926B):</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>The officer shall carry his/her Metro Transit Police Department identification card whenever carrying such weapon.</li>
        <li>The officer is not the subject of any current disciplinary action.</li>
        <li>The officer may not be under the influence of alcohol or any other intoxicating or hallucinatory drug.</li>
        <li>The officer will remain subject to this and all other department policies (including qualifying and training).</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Officers are cautioned that individual states may enact local regulations that permit private persons or entities to prohibit or restrict the possession of concealed firearms on their property, or that prohibit or restrict the possession of firearms on any state or local government property, installation, building, base or park. Federal authority may not shield an officer from arrest and prosecution in such locally restricted areas.</p>
    <p>Active law enforcement officers from other states are subject to all requirements set forth in 18 USC § 926B.</p>
</div>

            <div class="chapter" id="314">
    <h2>314 - Vehicle Pursuits</h2>
    <h3>314.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>Vehicle pursuits expose innocent citizens, law enforcement officers and fleeing violators to the risk of serious injury or death. The primary purpose of this policy is to provide officers with guidance in balancing the safety of the public and themselves against law enforcement's duty to apprehend violators of the law. Another purpose of this policy is to minimize the potential for pursuit-related collisions. Vehicular pursuits require officers to exhibit a high degree of common sense and sound judgment. Officers must not forget that the immediate apprehension of a suspect is generally not more important than the safety of the public and pursuing officers (Minn. Stat. § 626.8458 Subd. 1).</p>
    <h4>314.1.1 PHILOSOPHY</h4>
    <p>Deciding whether to pursue a motor vehicle is a critical decision that must be made quickly and under difficult and unpredictable circumstances. In recognizing the risk to public safety created by vehicle pursuits, no officer or supervisor shall be criticized or disciplined for deciding not to engage in a vehicle pursuit due to the risk involved. This includes circumstances where Department policy would permit the initiation or continuation of the pursuit. It is recognized that vehicle pursuits are not always predictable and decisions made pursuant to this policy will be evaluated according to the totality of the circumstances reasonably available at the time of the pursuit (Minn. Stat. § 626.8458 Subd. 1).</p>
    <p>Officers must remember that the most important factors to the successful conclusion of a pursuit are proper self-discipline and sound professional judgment. Officers conduct during the course of a pursuit must be objectively reasonable; that is, what a reasonable officer would do under the circumstances. An individual’s unreasonable desire to apprehend a fleeing suspect at all costs has no place in professional law enforcement pursuit (Minn. Stat. § 626.8458 Subd. 2 (2)).</p>

    <h3>314.2 DEFINITIONS</h3>
    <p>Definitions related to this policy include:</p>
    <p><strong>Blocking or vehicle intercept</strong> - A slow-speed coordinated maneuver where two or more law enforcement vehicles simultaneously intercept and block the movement of a suspect vehicle, the driver of which may be unaware of the impending enforcement stop, with the goal of containment and preventing a pursuit. Blocking is not a moving or stationary road block.</p>
    <p><strong>Boxing-in</strong> - A tactic designed to stop a violator's vehicle by surrounding it with law enforcement vehicles and then slowing all vehicles to a stop.</p>
    <p><strong>Pursuit Intervention Technique (PIT)</strong> - A low-speed maneuver intended to terminate the pursuit by causing the violator's vehicle to spin out and come to a stop.</p>
    <p><strong>Ramming</strong> - The deliberate act of impacting a violator's vehicle with another vehicle to functionally damage or otherwise force the violator's vehicle to stop.</p>
    <p><strong>Roadblocks</strong> - A tactic designed to stop a violator's vehicle by intentionally placing a vehicle or other immovable object in the path of the violator's vehicle.</p>
    <p><strong>Spikes or tack strips</strong> - A device that extends across the roadway and is designed to puncture the tires of the pursued vehicle.</p>
    <p><strong>Terminate</strong> - When the officer discontinues the use of all emergency equipment, slows the marked squad car to the posted speed limit and turns off the pursuit route at the next available intersection or exit point.</p>
    <p><strong>Vehicle pursuit</strong> - An event in which a peace officer initiates a vehicular stop and a driver resists the signal or order to stop by increasing speed, taking evasive action or otherwise refusing to stop the vehicle.</p>

    <h3>314.3 OFFICER RESPONSIBILITIES</h3>
    <p>It is the policy of this department that a vehicle pursuit shall be conducted with at least one flashing red warning lamp visible from the front and a siren that is sounded when necessary to warn pedestrians or other drivers (Minn. Stat. § 169.17 and Minn. Stat. § 169.68).</p>
    <p>Operating an emergency vehicle in a pursuit with emergency lights and siren does not relieve the operator of an authorized emergency vehicle of the duty to drive with due regard for the safety of all persons, and does not protect the driver from the consequences of a reckless disregard for the safety of others.</p>
    <h4>314.3.1 WHEN TO INITIATE A PURSUIT</h4>
    <p>Officers are authorized to initiate a pursuit when it is reasonable to believe that a suspect is attempting to evade arrest or detention by fleeing in a vehicle that has been given a signal to stop by a peace officer.</p>
    <p>The following factors individually and collectively shall be considered in deciding whether to initiate or continue a pursuit (Minn. Stat. § 626.8458 Subd. 2(2); Minn. R. § 6700.2701):</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Seriousness of the known or reasonably suspected crime and its relationship to community safety.</li>
        <li>The importance of protecting the public and balancing the known or reasonably suspected offense and the apparent need for immediate capture against the risks to officers, innocent motorists and others.</li>
        <li>Apparent nature of the fleeing suspect (e.g., whether the suspect represents a serious threat to public safety).</li>
        <li>The identity of the suspect has been verified and there is comparatively minimal risk in allowing the suspect to be apprehended at a later time.</li>
        <li>Safety of the public in the area of the pursuit, including the type of area, time of day, the amount of vehicular and pedestrian traffic (e.g., school zones) and the speed of the pursuit relative to these factors.</li>
        <li>Pursuing officer's familiarity with the area of the pursuit, the quality of radio communications between the pursuing units and the dispatcher/supervisor, and the driving capabilities of the pursuing officers under the conditions of the pursuit.</li>
        <li>Weather, traffic and road conditions that unreasonably increase the danger of the pursuit when weighed against the risks resulting from the suspect's escape.</li>
        <li>Performance capabilities of the vehicles used in the pursuit in relation to the speeds and other conditions of the pursuit.</li>
        <li>Vehicle speeds.</li>
        <li>Other persons in or on the pursued vehicle (e.g., passengers, co-offenders and hostages).</li>
        <li>Age of the suspect and occupants.</li>
        <li>Availability of other resources, such as aircraft assistance.</li>
        <li>The police unit is carrying passengers other than on-duty police officers. Pursuits should not be undertaken with a prisoner in the pursuit vehicle unless exigent circumstances exist, and then only after the need to apprehend the suspect is weighed against the safety of the prisoner in transport. A unit containing more than a single prisoner should not participate in a pursuit.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>314.3.2 WHEN TO TERMINATE A PURSUIT</h4>
    <p>Pursuits should be discontinued whenever the totality of objective circumstances known or which reasonably ought to be known to the officer or supervisor during the pursuit indicates that the present risks of continuing the pursuit reasonably appear to outweigh the risks resulting from the suspect's escape.</p>
    <p>The above factors on when to initiate a pursuit are expressly included herein and will apply equally to the decision to discontinue as well as the decision to initiate a pursuit. Officers and supervisors must objectively and continuously weigh the seriousness of the offense against the potential danger to innocent motorists, themselves and the public when electing to continue a pursuit. In the context of this policy, the term “terminate” shall be construed to mean discontinue or to stop chasing the fleeing vehicle.</p>
    <p>In addition to the factors listed above, the following factors should be considered when deciding whether to terminate a pursuit (Minn. Stat. § 626.8458 Subd. 2 (2); Minn. R. § 6700.2701):</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Distance between the pursuing officers and the fleeing vehicle is so great that further pursuit would be futile or require the pursuit to continue for an unreasonable time or distance.</li>
        <li>Pursued vehicle's location is no longer definitely known.</li>
        <li>Officer's pursuit vehicle sustains damage or a mechanical failure that renders it unsafe to drive</li>
        <li>ursuit vehicle suffers an emergency equipment failure that causes the vehicle to no longer qualify for emergency operation use.</li>
        <li>Extended pursuits of violators for misdemeanors not involving abuse or risk of serious harm (independent of the pursuit) are discouraged.</li>
        <li>Hazards to uninvolved bystanders or motorists.</li>
        <li>If the identity of the offender is known and it does not reasonably appear that the need for immediate capture outweighs the risks associated with continuing the pursuit, officers should strongly consider discontinuing the pursuit and apprehending the offender at a later time.</li>
        <li>When radio communications are broken or inadequate.</li>
        <li>When the danger that the continued pursuit poses to the public, the officers or the suspect is too great, balanced against the risk of allowing the suspect to remain at large.</li>
        <li>When directed to terminate the pursuit by a supervisor.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>314.3.3 SPEED LIMITS</h4>
    <p>The speed of a pursuit is a factor that should be evaluated on a continuing basis by the officer and supervisor. Evaluation of vehicle speeds shall take into consideration public safety, officer safety and the safety of the occupants of the fleeing vehicle.</p>
    <p>Should high vehicle speeds be reached during a pursuit, officers and supervisors shall also consider these factors when determining the reasonableness of the speed of the pursuit:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Pursuit speeds have become unreasonably unsafe for the surrounding conditions.</li>
        <li>Pursuit speeds have exceeded the driving ability of the officer.</li>
        <li>Pursuit speeds are beyond the capabilities of the pursuit vehicle thus making its operation unsafe.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>314.4 PURSUIT UNITS</h3>
    <p>Pursuit units should be limited to three vehicles (two units and a supervisor). However, the number of units involved will vary with the circumstances (Minn. R. § 6700.2701 (B)).</p>
    <p>An officer or supervisor may request additional units to join a pursuit if, after assessing the factors outlined above, it appears that the number of officers involved would be insufficient to safely arrest the suspect(s). All other officers shall stay out of the pursuit but should remain alert to its progress and location. Any officer who drops out of a pursuit may then, if necessary, proceed to the termination point at legal speeds, following the appropriate rules of the road.</p>
    <p>Distinctively marked patrol vehicles should replace unmarked vehicles involved in a pursuit whenever practicable.</p>
    <h4>314.4.1 VEHICLES WITHOUT EMERGENCY EQUIPMENT</h4>
    <p>Vehicles not equipped with red light and siren are prohibited from initiating or joining in any pursuit. Officer(s) in such vehicles may provide support to pursuing units as long as their vehicle is operated in compliance with all traffic laws.</p>
    <h4>314.4.2 PRIMARY UNIT RESPONSIBILITIES</h4>
    <p>The initial pursuing officer will be designated as the primary pursuit unit and will be responsible for the conduct of the pursuit unless it is unable to remain reasonably close enough to the violator’s vehicle. The primary responsibility of the officer initiating the pursuit is the apprehension of the suspect(s) without unreasonable danger to him/herself or other persons (Minn. Stat. § 626.8458 Subd. 2 (4)).</p>
    <p>The primary unit should notify Transit Control Center, commencing with a request for priority radio traffic, that a vehicle pursuit has been initiated, and as soon as practicable provide information including, but not limited to:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Reason for the pursuit.</li>
        <li>Location and direction of travel.</li>
        <li>Speed of the fleeing vehicle.</li>
        <li>Description of the fleeing vehicle and license number, if known.</li>
        <li>Number of occupants.</li>
        <li>The identity or description of the known occupants.</li>
        <li>Weather, road and traffic conditions.</li>
        <li>Identity of other agencies involved in the pursuit.</li>
        <li>Information concerning the use of firearms, threat of force, injuries, hostages or other unusual hazards.</li>
        <li>Request for medical assistance for any person injured in the course of the pursuit (Minn. Stat. § 626.8458 Subd. 2 (6); Minn. R. § 6700.2701).</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Unless relieved by a supervisor or secondary unit, the officer in the primary unit shall be responsible for broadcasting the progress of the pursuit. Unless circumstances reasonably indicate otherwise, the primary unit should relinquish the responsibility of broadcasting the progress of the pursuit to a secondary unit or aircraft joining the pursuit to minimize distractions and allow the primary unit to concentrate foremost on safe pursuit tactics (Minn. R. § 6700.2701).</p>
    <h4>314.4.3 SECONDARY UNITS RESPONSIBILITIES</h4>
    <p>The second officer in the pursuit is responsible for the following (Minn. R. § 6700.2701):</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Immediately notifying the dispatcher of entry into the pursuit.</li>
        <li>Remaining at a safe distance behind the primary unit unless directed to assume the role of primary officer, or if the primary unit is unable to continue the pursuit.</p>
            <p><br></li>
        <li>Broadcasting the progress of the pursuit unless the situation indicates otherwise.</li>
        <li>Serve as backup to the primary unit once the subject has been stopped.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>314.4.4 PURSUIT DRIVING TACTICS</h4>
    <p>The decision to use or not use specific driving tactics requires the same assessment of considerations outlined in the factors to be considered concerning pursuit initiation and termination. The following are tactics for units involved in the pursuit (Minn. Stat. § 626.8458 Subd. 2 (2)):</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Officers, considering their driving skills and vehicle performance capabilities, will space themselves from other involved vehicles such that they are able to see and avoid hazards or react safely to maneuvers by the fleeing vehicle.</li>
        <li>Officers may proceed past a red or stop signal or stop sign but only after slowing down and utilizing a flashing red lamp or siren as may be necessary for safe operation (Minn. Stat. § 169.03, Subd. 2).</li>
        <li>As a general rule, officers should not pursue a vehicle driving the wrong way on a roadway, highway or freeway. In the event the pursued vehicle does so, the following tactics should be considered:</p>
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>Request assistance from an available air unit.</li>
                <li>Maintain visual contact with the pursued vehicle by paralleling on the correct side of the roadway.</li>
                <li>Request other units to observe exits available to the suspect(s).</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Notify the Minnesota State Patrol or other law enforcement agency if it appears the pursuit may enter their jurisdiction.</li>
        <li>Officers involved in a pursuit should not attempt to pass other units unless the situation indicates otherwise or they are requested to do so by the primary unit, and a clear understanding of the maneuver process exists between the involved officers.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>314.4.5 TACTICS/PROCEDURES FOR UNITS NOT INVOLVED IN THE PURSUIT</h4>
    <p>There should be no paralleling of the pursuit route. Officers are authorized to use emergency equipment at intersections along the pursuit path to clear intersections of vehicular and pedestrian traffic to protect the public. Officers should remain in their assigned area and should not become involved with the pursuit unless directed otherwise by a supervisor.</p>
    <p>Non-pursuing personnel needed at the termination of the pursuit should respond in a non- emergency manner, observing the rules of the road.</p>
    <p>The primary unit, secondary unit and supervisor should be the only units operating under emergency conditions (emergency lights and siren) unless other units are assigned to the pursuit.</p>
    <h4>314.4.6 PURSUIT TRAILING</h4>
    <p>In the event the initiating unit from this agency relinquishes control of the pursuit to another unit or jurisdiction, that initiating unit may, with permission of a supervisor, trail the pursuit to the termination point in order to provide necessary information and assistance for the arrest of the suspect(s).</p>
    <p>The term "trail" means to follow the path of the pursuit at a safe speed while obeying all traffic laws and without activating emergency equipment. If the pursuit is at a slow rate of speed, the trailing unit will maintain sufficient distance from the pursuit units so as to clearly indicate an absence of participation in the pursuit.</p>
    <h4>314.4.7 AIRCRAFT ASSISTANCE</h4>
    <p>When available, aircraft assistance should be requested. Once the air unit has established visual contact with the pursued vehicle, it should assume control over the pursuit. The primary and secondary ground units should consider whether the participation of an aircraft warrants their continued involvement in the pursuit (Minn. Stat. § 626.8458 Subd. 2 (4)).</p>
    <p>The air unit should coordinate the activities of resources on the ground, report progress of the pursuit and provide officers and supervisors with details of upcoming traffic congestion, road hazards or other pertinent information to evaluate whether to continue the pursuit. If ground units are not within visual contact and the air unit determines that it is unsafe to continue the pursuit, the air unit should recommend terminating the pursuit.</p>

    <h3>314.5 SUPERVISORY CONTROL AND RESPONSIBILITIES</h3>
    <p>It is the policy of this department that available supervisory and management control will be exercised over all vehicle pursuits involving officers from this department (Minn. Stat. § 626.8458 Subd. 2 (4); Minn. R. § 6700.2701).</p>
    <p>The field supervisor of the officer initiating the pursuit, or if unavailable, the nearest field supervisor will be responsible for the following:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Upon becoming aware of a pursuit, immediately notify involved officers and Transit Control Center of supervisory presence and ascertaining all reasonably available information to continuously assess the situation and risk factors associated with the pursuit in order to ensure that the pursuit is conducted within established Department guidelines.</li>
        <li>Engage in the pursuit, when appropriate, to provide on-scene supervision.</li>
        <li>Exercise management and control of the pursuit even if not engaged in it.</li>
        <li>Ensure that no more than the number of required law enforcement units needed are involved in the pursuit under the guidelines set forth in this policy.</li>
        <li>Direct that the pursuit be terminated if, in his/her judgment, it is not justified to continue the pursuit under the guidelines of this policy.</li>
        <li>Ensure that aircraft assistance is requested if available.</li>
        <li>Ensure that the proper radio channel is being used.</li>
        <li>Ensure the notification and/or coordination of outside agencies if the pursuit either leaves or is likely to leave the jurisdiction of this agency.</li>
        <li>Control and manage MTPD units when a pursuit enters another jurisdiction.</li>
        <li>Prepare a post-pursuit critique and analysis of the pursuit for training purposes.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>314.5.1 SHIFT SUPERVISOR RESPONSIBILITIES</h4>
    <p>Upon becoming aware that a pursuit has been initiated, the Shift Supervisor should monitor and continually assess the situation and ensure the pursuit is conducted within the guidelines and requirements of this policy. The Shift Supervisor has the final responsibility for the coordination, control and termination of a vehicle pursuit and shall be in overall command (Minn. Stat. § 626.8458 Subd. 2 (4); Minn. R. § 6700.2701).</p>
    <p>The Shift Supervisor shall review all pertinent reports for content and forward them to the Captain.</p>

    <h3>314.6 COMMUNICATIONS</h3>
    <p>If the pursuit is confined within the Metropolitan Transit Police Department area limits, radio communications will be conducted on the primary channel unless instructed otherwise by a supervisor or communications dispatcher. If the pursuit leaves the jurisdiction of this department or such is imminent, involved units should, whenever available, switch radio communications to an emergency channel most accessible by participating agencies and units (e.g. local agency channel and/or P-Tac 1) (Minn. R. § 6700.2701).</p>
    <h4>314.6.1 TRANSIT CONTROL CENTER RESPONSIBILITIES</h4>
    <p>Upon notification that a pursuit has been initiated, Transit Control Center will be responsible for the following (Minn. Stat. § 626.8458 Subd. 2 (4)):</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Coordinate pursuit communications of the involved units and personnel.</li>
        <li>Notify and coordinate with other involved or affected agencies as practicable.</li>
        <li>Ensure that a field supervisor is notified of the pursuit.</li>
        <li>Assign an incident number and log all pursuit activities.</li>
        <li>Broadcast pursuit updates as well as other pertinent information as necessary.</li>
        <li>Notify the Shift Supervisor as soon as practicable.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>314.6.2 LOSS OF PURSUED VEHICLE</h4>
    <p>When the pursued vehicle is lost, the primary unit should broadcast pertinent information to assist other units in locating the vehicle. The primary unit will be responsible for coordinating any further search for either the pursued vehicle or suspects fleeing on foot.</p>

    <h3>314.7 INTER-JURISDICTIONAL CONSIDERATIONS</h3>
    <p>When a pursuit enters another agency's jurisdiction, the primary officer or supervisor, taking into consideration distance traveled, unfamiliarity with the area and other pertinent facts, should determine whether to request the other agency to assume the pursuit. Unless entry into another jurisdiction is expected to be brief, it is generally recommended that the primary officer or supervisor ensure that notification is provided to the dispatcher and to each outside jurisdiction into which the pursuit is reasonably expected to enter, regardless of whether such jurisdiction is expected to assist (Minn. Stat. § 626.8458 Subd. 2 (5); Minn. R. § 6700.2701).</p>
    <p>If a pursuit from another agency enters the Department’s jurisdiction, if aware, the Transit Control Center should update the on-duty supervisor.</p>
    <h4>314.7.1 ASSUMPTION OF PURSUIT BY ANOTHER AGENCY</h4>
    <p>Metro Transit Police Department officers will discontinue the pursuit when another agency has assumed the pursuit unless continued assistance of the Metro Transit Police Department is requested by the agency assuming the pursuit. Upon discontinuing the pursuit, the primary unit may proceed upon request, with or at the direction of a supervisor, to the termination point to assist in the investigation.</p>
    <p>The role and responsibilities of officers at the termination of a pursuit initiated by this department shall be coordinated with appropriate consideration of the units from the agency assuming the pursuit.</p>
    <p>Notification of a pursuit in progress should not be construed as a request to join the pursuit. Requests to or from another agency to assume a pursuit should be specific. Because of communication limitations between local agencies, a request for another agency's assistance will mean that its personnel will assume responsibilities for the pursuit. For the same reasons, when a pursuit leaves another jurisdiction and a request for assistance is made to this department, the other agency should relinquish control.</p>
    <h4>314.7.2 PURSUITS EXTENDING INTO THIS JURISDICTION</h4>
    <p>The agency that initiates a pursuit shall be responsible for conducting the pursuit. Units from this department should not join a pursuit unless specifically requested to do so by the agency whose peace officers are in pursuit. An exception to being specifically requested to join a pursuit, is if the initiating agency has only a single unit in the pursuit. Under this circumstance, and if authorized by a supervisor, a unit from this department may join the pursuit until sufficient units from the initiating agency join the pursuit.</p>
    <p>When a request is made for this department to assist or take over a pursuit from another agency that has entered this jurisdiction, the supervisor should consider these additional following factors:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Ability to maintain the pursuit.</li>
        <li>Circumstances serious enough to continue the pursuit.</li>
        <li>Adequate staffing to continue the pursuit.</li>
        <li>The public's safety within this jurisdiction.</li>
        <li>Safety of the pursuing officers.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>As soon as practicable, the Shift Supervisor should review a request for assistance from another agency. The Shift Supervisor, after consideration of the above factors, may decline to assist in or assume the other agency's pursuit.</p>
    <p>Assistance to a pursuing outside agency by officers of this department will terminate when the supervisor orders the termination or when the pursuing peace officers have sufficient assistance from other sources. Ongoing participation from this department may continue only until sufficient assistance is present.</p>
    <p>In the event that a pursuit from another agency terminates within the Metro Transit Police Department's jurisdiction, officers shall provide appropriate assistance to peace officers from the outside agency including, but not limited to, scene control, coordination and completion of supplemental reports and any other assistance requested or needed.</p>

    <h3>314.8 PURSUIT INTERVENTION</h3>
    <p>Pursuit intervention is an attempt to terminate the ability of a suspect to continue to flee in a motor vehicle through tactical application of technology, road spikes, blocking, boxing, PIT (Pursuit Intervention Technique), ramming or roadblock procedures.</p>
    <h4>314.8.1 WHEN USE AUTHORIZED</h4>
    <p>Use of pursuit intervention tactics should be employed only after approval of a supervisor. In deciding whether to use intervention tactics, officers/supervisors should balance the risks of allowing the pursuit to continue with the potential hazards arising from the use of each tactic to the public, the officers and persons in or on the pursued vehicle. With these risks in mind, the decision to use any intervention tactic should be reasonable in light of the circumstances apparent to the officer at the time of the decision (Minn. Stat. § 626.8458 Subd. 2; Minn. R. § 6700.2701).</p>
    <p>It is imperative that officers act within legal bounds using good judgment and accepted practices.</p>
    <h4>314.8.2 USE OF FIREARMS</h4>
    <p>The use of firearms to disable a pursued vehicle is not generally an effective tactic and involves all the dangers associated with discharging firearms. Officers should not utilize firearms during an ongoing pursuit unless the conditions and circumstances meet the requirements authorizing the use of deadly force. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit any officer from using a firearm to stop a suspect from using a vehicle as a deadly weapon.</p>
    <h4>314.8.3 INTERVENTION STANDARDS</h4>
    <p>Any pursuit intervention tactic, depending upon the conditions and circumstances under which it is used, may present dangers to the officers, the public or anyone in or on the vehicle being pursued. Certain applications of intervention tactics may be construed to be a use of force, including deadly force, and are subject to Department policies guiding such use. Officers who have not received Department-approved training in the application and use of any intervention tactic or</p>
    <p>equipment shall consider these facts and requirements prior to deciding how, when, where and if an intervention tactic should be employed.</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Blocking or vehicle intercept should only be considered in cases involving felony suspects or impaired drivers who pose a threat to public safety when officers reasonably believe that attempting a conventional enforcement stop will likely result in the driver attempting to flee in the vehicle. Because of the potential risks involved, this technique should only be employed by officers who have received training in such tactics and after giving consideration to the following:
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>The need to immediately stop the suspect vehicle or prevent it from leaving substantially outweighs the risks of injury or death to occupants of the suspect vehicle, officers or other members of the public.</li>
                <li>All other reasonable intervention techniques have failed or reasonably appear ineffective.</li>
                <li>Employing the blocking maneuver does not unreasonably increase the risk to officer safety.</li>
                <li>The target vehicle is stopped or traveling at a low speed.</li>
                <li>At no time should civilian vehicles be used to deploy this technique.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Only those officers trained in the use of the PIT will be authorized to use this procedure and only then with approval of a supervisor upon consideration of the circumstances and conditions presented at the time, including the potential for risk of injury to officers, the public and occupants of the pursued vehicle.</li>
        <li>Ramming a fleeing vehicle should be done only after other reasonable tactical means at the officer's disposal have been exhausted. This tactic should be reserved for situations where there does not appear to be another reasonable alternative method. This policy is an administrative guide to direct officers in their decision-making process before ramming another vehicle. When ramming is used as a means to stop a fleeing vehicle, the following factors should be present:
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>The suspect is an actual or suspected felon, who reasonably appears to represent a serious threat to the public if not apprehended.</li>
                <li>The suspect is driving with willful or wanton disregard for the safety of other persons or is driving in a reckless and life-endangering manner.</li>
                <li>If there does not reasonably appear to be a present or immediately foreseeable serious threat to the public, the use of ramming is not authorized.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>As with all intervention techniques, pursuing officers should obtain supervisor approval before attempting to box a suspect vehicle during a pursuit. The use of such a technique must be carefully coordinated with all involved units, taking into consideration the circumstances and conditions apparent at the time, as well as the potential risk of injury to officers, the public and occupants of the pursued vehicle.</li>
        <li>Spike strips should be deployed only when it is reasonably apparent that only the pursued vehicle will be affected by their use. Prior to the deployment of spike strips, the officer shall notify pursuing units and the supervisor of the intent and location. Officers should carefully consider the limitations of such devices as well as the potential risks to officers, the public and occupants of the pursued vehicle. If the pursued vehicle is a motorcycle, a vehicle transporting hazardous materials or a school bus transporting children officers and supervisors should weigh the potential consequences against the need to immediately stop the vehicle.</li>
        <li>Because roadblocks involve a potential for serious injury or death to occupants of the pursued vehicle if the suspect does not stop, the intentional placement of roadblocks in the direct path of a pursued vehicle is generally discouraged and should not be deployed without prior approval of a supervisor, and only then under extraordinary conditions when all other reasonable intervention techniques have failed or reasonably appear ineffective and the need to immediately stop the pursued vehicle substantially outweighs the risks of injury or death to occupants of the pursued vehicle, officers or other members of the public.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>314.8.4 CAPTURE OF SUSPECTS</h4>
    <p>Proper self-discipline and sound professional judgment are the keys to a successful conclusion of a pursuit and apprehension of evading suspects. Officers shall use only that amount of force that reasonably appears necessary under the circumstances to properly perform their lawful duties.</p>
    <p>Unless relieved by a supervisor, the primary officer should coordinate efforts to apprehend the suspect(s) following the pursuit. Officers should consider safety of the public and the involved officers when formulating plans to contain and capture the suspect.</p>

    <h3>314.9 REPORTING AND REVIEW REQUIREMENTS</h3>
    <p>All appropriate reports shall be completed to comply with appropriate local and state regulations. The Records Supervisor shall ensure the appropriate forms are filed with the Department of Public Safety within 30 days (Minn. Stat. § 626.5532):</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>The primary officer shall complete appropriate crime/arrest reports.</li>
        <li>The primary officer or supervisor shall complete the appropriate pursuit report.</li>
        <li>After first obtaining available information, the on-duty field supervisor shall promptly complete a Supervisor's Log or interoffice memorandum, briefly summarizing the pursuit to the Chief of Police or designee. This memo should minimally contain the following information (Minn. Stat. § 626.5532):
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>Date and time of pursuit.</li>
                <li>Length of pursuit in distance and time.</li>
                <li>Involved units and officers.</li>
                <li>Initial reason and circumstances surrounding the pursuit.</li>

                <li>A preliminary determination that the pursuit appears to be in compliance with this policy or additional review and/or follow-up is warranted.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>After receiving copies of reports, logs and other pertinent information, the Chief of Police or designee shall conduct or assign the completion of a post-pursuit review as appropriate to the circumstances.</li>
        <li>Annually, the Chief of Police should direct a documented review and analysis of Department vehicle pursuits to minimally include policy suitability, policy compliance and training needs.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>314.9.1 REGULAR AND PERIODIC PURSUIT TRAINING</h4>
    <p>In addition to initial and supplementary training on pursuits, all licensed non-exempt employees will participate, no less than annually, in regular and periodic training on this policy and the importance of vehicle safety and protecting the public at all times. Training will include a recognition of the need to balance the known offense and the need for immediate capture against the risks to officers and others.</p>
    <p>The Training Coordinator shall ensure the frequency and content of emergency vehicle operations and vehicle pursuit training meets or exceeds that required by law (Minn. Stat. § 626.8458 Subd. 5; Minn. R. § 6700.2702).</p>

            <div class="chapter" id="316">
    <h2>316 - Officer Response to Calls</h2>
    <h3>316.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>The State of Minnesota finds that emergency vehicle operations are an integral part of law enforcement’s commitment to public safety. This policy provides for the safe and appropriate response to all emergency and non-emergency situations (Minn. Stat. § 626.8458 Subd. 1).</p>

    <h3>316.2 RESPONSE TO CALLS</h3>
    <h4>316.2.1 RESPONSE TO EMERGENCY CALLS</h4>
    <p>Officers responding to an emergency call shall proceed immediately as appropriate. Officers responding to an emergency call shall sound the siren or display at least one lighted red light to the front of the vehicle. Whenever practicable, during an emergency call response the officer should continuously operate emergency lighting equipment and sound the siren (Minn. Stat. § 169.03 et seq.; Minn. Stat. § 169.17).</p>
    <p>Responding with a red light, emergency lighting and/or siren does not relieve the operator of an authorized emergency vehicle or a law enforcement vehicle of the duty to drive with due regard for the safety of all persons and does not protect the driver from the consequences of his/her reckless disregard for the safety of others. The use of any other warning equipment without emergency lights and siren does not provide an exemption under Minnesota law (Minn. Stat. § 169.17).</p>
    <p>Officers should only respond with a red light, emergency lights and/or siren when so dispatched or when circumstances reasonably indicate an emergency response is appropriate. Officers not responding with a red light, emergency lights and/or siren shall observe all traffic laws.</p>
    <h4>316.2.2 LIGHTING EXEMPTION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT VEHICLES</h4>
    <p>An officer may operate a vehicle without lights as otherwise required when (Minn. Stat. § 169.541):</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>It is reasonable for the officer to do so under the circumstances.</li>
        <li>The officer reasonably believes that operating the vehicle without lights is necessary to investigate a criminal violation or suspected criminal violation of state laws, rules or orders, or local laws, ordinances or regulations; and</li>
        <li>There are no conditions of limited or reduced visibility (defined in Minn. Stat. § 84.87; Minn. Stat. § 84.928; Minn. Stat. § 169.48-169.65; Minn. Stat. § 86B.511); and the officer is not driving:
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>On an interstate highway.</li>
                <li>At speeds greater than what is reasonable and prudent under existing weather, road and traffic conditions.</li>
                <li>Faster than the posted speed limit.</li>
                <li>In situations where the peace officer is an active participant in the pursuit of a motor vehicle in violation of Minn. Stat. § 609.487.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>316.3 REQUESTING EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE</h3>
    <p>Requests for emergency assistance should be limited to those situations where the involved personnel reasonably believe that there is an imminent threat to the safety of officers, or assistance is needed to prevent imminent serious harm to a citizen. Where a situation has stabilized and emergency response is not required, the requesting officer shall promptly notify Transit Control Center.</p>
    <p>If circumstances permit, the requesting officer should give the following information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The unit number</li>
        <li>The location</li>
        <li>The reason for the request and type of emergency</li>
        <li>The number of units required</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>316.3.1 NUMBER OF UNITS PARTICIPATING</h4>
    <p>Normally, only those units reasonably necessary should respond to an emergency as an emergency call response. The Shift Supervisor or the field supervisor should monitor all emergency responses and reduce or enhance the response as warranted.</p>

    <h3>316.4 RESPONSIBILITIES OF RESPONDING OFFICERS</h3>
    <p>Officers shall exercise sound judgment and care with due regard for life and property when responding to an emergency call. During a response to an emergency call officers may (Minn. Stat. § 169.03; Minn. Stat. § 169.17):</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Proceed cautiously past a red or stop signal or stop sign but only after slowing down and utilizing a red light or siren as may be necessary for safe operation.</li>
        <li>Exceed any speed limits, provided this does not endanger life or property.</li>
        <li>Disregard regulations governing direction of movement or turning in specified directions as authorized by law.</li>
        <li>Disregard regulations governing parking or standing when using a warning lamp.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The decision to continue an emergency call response is at the discretion of the officer. If, in the officer's judgment, the roadway conditions or traffic congestion does not permit such a response without unreasonable risk, the officer may elect to respond to the call without the use of red lights and siren at the legal speed limit. In such an event, the officer should immediately notify Transit Control Center. An officer shall also discontinue an emergency call response when directed by a supervisor or as otherwise appropriate.</p>
    <p>Upon determining that an emergency call response is appropriate, an officer shall immediately give the location from which he/she is responding.</p>
    <p>When emergency vehicles are on the scene of an emergency and pose any hazard, or when the vehicle operators seek exemption to park, stop or stand contrary to any law or ordinance pursuant to Minn. Stat. § 169.541, adequate warning lights shall be operated whenever practicable.</p>

    <h3>316.5 COMMUNICATIONS RESPONSIBILITIES</h3>
    <p>A dispatcher shall ensure acknowledgment and response of assisting units when an officer requests emergency assistance or when the available information reasonably indicates that the public is threatened with serious injury or death and an immediate law enforcement response is needed. In all other circumstances, the dispatcher shall obtain authorization from the Shift Supervisor prior to assigning an emergency response. The dispatcher shall:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Attempt to assign the closest available unit to the location requiring assistance.</li>
        <li>Immediately notify the Shift Supervisor (if applicable).</li>
        <li>Confirm the location from which the unit is responding.</li>
        <li>Notify and coordinate outside emergency services (e.g., local agency police, fire and ambulance).</li>
        <li>Continue to obtain and broadcast information as necessary concerning the response, and monitor the situation until it is stabilized or terminated.</li>
        <li>Control all radio communications during the emergency and coordinate assistance under the direction of the Shift Supervisor.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>316.6 SUPERVISORY RESPONSIBILITIES</h3>
    <p>Upon being notified that an emergency response has been initiated, the Shift Supervisor shall verify the following:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>The proper response has been initiated.</li>
        <li>No more than those units reasonably necessary under the circumstances are involved in the response.</li>
        <li>Affected outside jurisdictions are being notified as practicable.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The Shift Supervisor shall, whenever practicable, monitor the response until it has been stabilized or terminated and assert control by directing units into or out of the response if necessary. If, in the supervisor's judgment, the circumstances require additional units to be assigned an emergency response, the supervisor may do so.</p>
    <p>It is the supervisor's responsibility to terminate an emergency response that, in his/her judgment, is inappropriate due to the circumstances.</p>
    <p>When making the decision to authorize an emergency call response, the Shift Supervisor should consider the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The type of call or crime involved.</li>
        <li>The necessity of a timely response.</li>
        <li>Traffic and roadway conditions.</li>
        <li>The location of the responding units.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>316.7 FAILURE OF EMERGENCY EQUIPMENT</h3>
    <p>If the emergency equipment on the vehicle should fail to operate, the officer must terminate the emergency call response and respond accordingly. The officer shall notify the Shift Supervisor and the Transit Control Center of the equipment failure so that another unit may be assigned to the emergency response.</p>

    <h3>316.8 TRAINING</h3>
    <p>The Training Coordinator shall ensure the frequency and content of emergency vehicle operations training meets or exceeds that required by law (Minn. Stat. § 626.8458).</p>
</div>

            <div class="chapter" id="318">
    <h2>318 - Canines</h2>
    <h3>318.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>This policy establishes guidelines for the use of canines to augment law enforcement services to the community including, but not limited to, locating individuals and contraband and apprehending criminal offenders.</p>

    <h3>318.2 POLICY</h3>
    <p>It is the policy of the Metro Transit Police Department that teams of handlers and canines meet and maintain the appropriate proficiency to effectively and reasonably carry out legitimate law enforcement objectives.</p>

    <h3>318.3 ASSIGNMENT</h3>
    <p>Canine teams should be assigned to assist and supplement the Patrol Division. However, they may be assigned by the Shift Supervisor to other functions such as routine calls for service based on the current operational needs.</p>
    <p>Canine teams should generally not be assigned to handle routine matters that will take them out of service for extended periods of time and then only with the approval of the Shift Supervisor.</p>

    <h3>318.4 CANINE COORDINATOR</h3>
    <p>The canine coordinator shall be appointed by and directly responsible to the Patrol Captain or the authorized designee.</p>
    <p>The responsibilities of the coordinator include, but are not limited to:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Reviewing all canine use reports to ensure compliance with policy and to identify training issues and other needs of the program.</li>
        <li>Maintaining liaison with the vendor kennel(s).</li>
        <li>Maintaining liaison with command staff and functional supervisors.</li>
        <li>Maintaining liaison with other agency canine coordinators.</li>
        <li>Maintaining accurate records to document canine activities.</li>
        <li>Recommending and overseeing the procurement of equipment and services for the teams of handlers and canines.</li>
        <li>Scheduling all canine-related activities.</li>
        <li>Ensuring the canine teams are scheduled for regular training to maximize their capabilities.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>318.5 REQUESTS FOR CANINE TEAMS</h3>
    <p>Patrol Division members are encouraged to request the use of a canine. Requests for a canine team from department units outside of the Patrol Division shall be reviewed by the Shift Supervisor.</p>
    <h4>318.5.1 OUTSIDE AGENCY REQUEST</h4>
    <p>All requests for canine assistance from outside agencies must be approved by the Shift Supervisor and are subject to the following:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Canine teams shall not be used for any assignment that is not consistent with this policy.</li>
        <li>The canine handler shall have the authority to decline a request for any specific assignment that he/she deems unsuitable.</li>
        <li>Calling out off-duty canine teams is discouraged.</li>
        <li>It shall be the responsibility of the canine handler to coordinate operations with agency personnel in order to minimize the risk of unintended injury.</li>
        <li>It shall be the responsibility of the canine handler to complete all necessary reports or as directed.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>318.5.2 PUBLIC DEMONSTRATIONS</h4>
    <p>All public requests for a canine team shall be reviewed and, if appropriate, approved by the canine coordinator prior to making any resource commitment. The canine coordinator is responsible for obtaining resources and coordinating involvement in the demonstration to include proper safety protocols. Canine handlers shall not demonstrate any apprehension work unless authorized to do so by the canine coordinator.</p>

    <h3>318.6 APPREHENSION GUIDELINES</h3>
    <p>A canine may be used to locate and apprehend a suspect if the canine handler reasonably believes that the individual has either committed, is committing or threatening to commit any serious offense and if any of the following conditions exist:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>There is a reasonable belief the suspect poses an imminent threat of violence or serious harm to the public, any officer or the handler.</li>
        <li>The suspect is physically resisting or threatening to resist arrest and the use of a canine reasonably appears to be necessary to overcome such resistance.</li>
        <li>The suspect is believed to be concealed in an area where entry by other than the canine would pose a threat to the safety of officers or the public.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>It is recognized that situations may arise that do not fall within the provisions set forth in this policy. Such events require consideration of the totality of the circumstances and the use of an objective reasonableness standard applied to the decision to use a canine.</p>
    <p>Absent a reasonable belief that a suspect has committed, is committing or threatening to commit a serious offense mere flight from a pursuing officer without any of the above conditions shall not serve as the basis for the use of a canine to apprehend a suspect.</p>
    <p>Use of a canine to locate and apprehend a suspect wanted for a lesser criminal offense than those identified above requires approval from the Shift Supervisor. Absent a change in circumstances that present an imminent threat to officers the canine or the public, such canine use should be conducted on-leash or under conditions that minimize the likelihood the canine will bite or otherwise injure the individual.</p>
    <p>In all applications once the suspect has been located and no longer reasonably appears to present a threat or risk of escape the handler should secure the canine as soon as it becomes reasonably practicable. If the canine has apprehended the suspect with a secure bite, the handler should promptly command the canine to release the suspect.</p>
    <h4>318.6.1 PREPARATION FOR DEPLOYMENT</h4>
    <p>Prior to the use of a canine to search for or apprehend any suspect the canine handler and/or the supervisor on-scene should carefully consider all pertinent information reasonably available at the time. The information should include, but is not limited to:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The nature and seriousness of the suspected offense.</li>
        <li>Whether violence or weapons were used or are anticipated.</li>
        <li>The degree of resistance or threatened resistance, if any, the suspect has shown.</li>
        <li>The suspect’s known or perceived age.</li>
        <li>The potential for injury to officers or the public caused by the suspect if the canine is not utilized.</li>
        <li>Any potential danger to the public and/or other officers at the scene if the canine is released.</li>
        <li>The potential for the suspect to escape or flee if the canine is not utilized.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>As circumstances permit the canine handler should make every reasonable effort to communicate and coordinate with other involved members to minimize the risk of unintended injury.</p>
    <p>It is the canine handler’s responsibility to evaluate each situation and determine whether the use of a canine is appropriate and reasonable. The canine handler shall have the authority to decline the use of the canine whenever he/she deems deployment is unsuitable.</p>
    <p>A supervisor who is sufficiently apprised of the situation may prohibit deploying the canine.</p>
    <p>Unless otherwise directed by a supervisor assisting members should take direction from the handler in order to minimize interference with the canine.</p>
    <h4>318.6.2 WARNINGS AND ANNOUNCEMENTS</h4>
    <p>Unless it would increase the risk of injury or escape a clearly audible warning announcing that a canine will be used if the suspect does not surrender should be made prior to releasing a canine. The handler should allow a reasonable time for a suspect to surrender and should quiet the canine momentarily to listen for any verbal response to the warning. If reasonably feasible, other members should be in a location opposite the warning to verify that the announcement could be heard. If available, warnings given in other languages should be used as necessary.</p>
    <p>If a warning is not to be given, the canine handler when reasonably practicable should first advise the supervisor of his/her decision before releasing the canine. In the event of an apprehension the handler shall document in any related report how the warning was given and, if none was given, the reasons why.</p>
    <h4>318.6.3 REPORTING DEPLOYMENTS, BITES AND INJURIES</h4>
    <p>Whenever a canine deployment results in a bite or causes injury to an intended suspect a supervisor should be promptly notified and the injuries documented in a canine use report. The injured person shall be promptly treated by emergency medical services personnel and, if appropriate, transported to an appropriate medical facility for further treatment. The deployment and injuries should also be included in any related incident or arrest report.</p>
    <p>Any unintended bite or injury caused by a canine, whether on- or off-duty, shall be promptly reported to the canine coordinator. Unintended bites or injuries caused by a canine should be documented in an administrative report, not in a canine use report.</p>
    <p>If an individual alleges an injury, either visible or not visible, a supervisor shall be notified and both the individual’s injured and uninjured areas shall be photographed as soon as reasonably practicable after first tending to the immediate needs of the injured party. Photographs shall be retained as evidence in accordance with current department evidence procedures. The photographs shall be retained until the criminal proceeding is completed and the time for any related civil proceeding has expired.</p>
    <p>Canines used by law enforcement agencies are generally exempt from dangerous dog registration, impoundment and reporting requirements (Minn. Stat. § 347.51, Subd. 4).</p>

    <h3>318.7 NON-APPREHENSION GUIDELINES</h3>
    <p>Properly trained canines may be used to track or search for non-criminals (e.g., lost children, individuals who may be disoriented or in need of medical attention). The canine handler is responsible for determining the canine’s suitability for such assignments based on the conditions and the particular abilities of the canine. When the canine is deployed in a search or other non- apprehension operation the following guidelines apply.</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Absent a change in circumstances that present an immediate threat to officers the canine or the public, such applications should be conducted on-leash or under conditions that minimize the likelihood the canine will bite or otherwise injure the individual, if located.</li>
        <li>Unless otherwise directed by a supervisor assisting members should take direction from the handler in order to minimize interference with the canine.</li>
        <li>Throughout the deployment the handler should periodically give verbal assurances that the canine will not bite or hurt the individual and encourage the individual to make him/herself known.</li>
        <li>Once the individual has been located the canine should be placed in a down-stay or otherwise secured as soon as it becomes reasonably practicable.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>318.7.1 ARTICLE DETECTION</h4>
    <p>A canine trained to find objects or property related to a person or crime may be used to locate or identify articles. A canine search should be conducted in a manner that minimizes the likelihood of unintended bites or injuries.</p>
    <h4>318.7.2 NARCOTICS DETECTION</h4>
    <p>A canine trained in narcotics detection may be used in accordance with current law and under certain circumstances, including:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>The search of vehicles, buildings, bags and other articles.</li>
        <li>Assisting in the search for narcotics during a search warrant service.</li>
        <li>Obtaining a search warrant by using the narcotics-detection trained canine in support of probable cause.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>A narcotics-detection trained canine will not be used to search a person for narcotics unless the canine is trained to passively indicate the presence of narcotics.</p>
    <h4>318.7.3 BOMB/EXPLOSIVE DETECTION</h4>
    <p>Because of the high risk of danger to the public and officers when a bomb or other explosive device is suspected, the use of a canine team trained in explosive detection may be considered. When available an explosive-detection canine team may be used in accordance with current law and under certain circumstances, including:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Assisting in the search of a building, structure, area, vehicle or article where an actual or suspected explosive device has been reported or located.</li>
        <li>Assisting with searches at transportation facilities and vehicles (e.g., buses, airplanes and trains).</li>
        <li>Preventive searches at special events, VIP visits, official buildings and other restricted areas. Searches of individuals should remain minimally intrusive and shall be strictly limited to the purpose of detecting explosives.</li>
        <li>Assisting in the search of scenes where an explosion has occurred and an explosive device or secondary explosive device is suspected.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>At no time will an explosive-detection trained canine be used to render a suspected device safe or clear.</p>

    <h3>318.8 HANDLER SELECTION</h3>
    <p>The minimum qualifications for the assignment of canine handler include:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>An officer who is currently off probation.</li>

        <li>Any changes in the living status of the handler that may affect the lodging or environment of the canine shall be reported to the canine coordinator as soon as possible.</li>
        <li>When off-duty the canine shall be in a kennel provided by the MTPD at the home of the handler. When a canine is kenneled at the handler’s home the gate shall be secured with a lock. When off-duty the canine may be let out of the kennel while under the direct control of the handler.</li>
        <li>The canine should be permitted to socialize in the home with the handler’s family for short periods of time and under the direct supervision of the handler.</li>
        <li>Under no circumstances will the canine be lodged at another location unless approved by the canine coordinator or Shift Supervisor.</li>
        <li>When off-duty the handler shall not involve the canine in any law enforcement activity or official conduct unless approved in advance by the canine coordinator or Shift Supervisor.</li>
        <li>Whenever a canine handler is off-duty for an extended number of days it may be necessary to temporarily relocate the canine. In those situations the handler shall give reasonable notice to the canine coordinator so that appropriate arrangements can be made.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>318.9.1 CANINE IN PUBLIC AREAS</h4>
    <p>The canine should be kept on a leash when in areas that allow access to the public. Exceptions to this rule would include specific law enforcement operations for which the canine is trained.</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>A canine shall not be left unattended in any area to which the public may have access.</li>
        <li>When the canine vehicle is left unattended all windows and doors shall be secured in such a manner as to prevent unauthorized access to the dog. The handler shall also ensure the unattended vehicle remains inhabitable for the canine.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>318.10 HANDLER COMPENSATION</h3>
    <p>The canine handler shall be available for call-out under conditions specified by the canine coordinator.</p>
    <p>The canine handler shall be compensated for time spent in the care, feeding, grooming and other needs of the canine in accordance with the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), and according to the terms of the memorandum of understanding (29 USC § 207).</p>

    <h3>318.11 CANINE INJURY AND MEDICAL CARE</h3>
    <p>In the event that a canine is injured or there is an indication that the canine is not in good physical condition the injury or condition will be reported to the canine coordinator or Shift Supervisor as soon as practicable and appropriately documented.</p>
    <p>All medical attention shall be rendered by the designated canine veterinarian, except during an emergency where treatment should be obtained from the nearest available veterinarian. All records of medical treatment shall be maintained in the handler’s personnel file.</p>

    <h3>318.12 TRAINING</h3>
    <p>Before assignment in the field each canine team shall be trained and certified to meet current nationally recognized standards or other recognized and approved certification standards. Cross- trained canine teams or those canine teams trained exclusively for the detection of narcotics and/ or explosives also shall be trained and certified to meet current nationally recognized standards or other recognized and approved certification standards established for their particular skills.</p>
    <p>The canine coordinator shall be responsible for scheduling periodic training for all departmentmembers in order to familiarize them with how to conduct themselves in the presence of department canines.</p>
    <p>All canine training should be conducted while on-duty unless otherwise approved by the canine coordinator or Shift Supervisor.</p>
    <h4>318.12.1 CONTINUED TRAINING</h4>
    <p>Each canine team shall thereafter be recertified to a current nationally recognized standard or other recognized and approved certification standards on an annual basis. Additional training considerations are as follows:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>If applicable, canine teams should receive training as defined in the current contract with the Metro Transit Police Department canine training provider.</li>
        <li>Canine handlers are encouraged to engage in additional training with approval of the canine coordinator.</li>
        <li>To ensure that all training is consistent no handler, trainer or outside vendor is authorized to train to a standard that is not reviewed and approved by this department.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>318.12.2 FAILURE TO SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE TRAINING</h4>
    <p>Any canine team failing to graduate or obtain certification shall not be deployed in the field for tasks the team is not certified to perform until graduation or certification is achieved. When reasonably practicable pending successful certification the canine handler shall be temporarily reassigned to regular patrol duties.</p>
    <li><a name="bookmark315">TRAINING RECORDS</a></p>
    <p>All canine training records shall be maintained in the canine handler’s and the canine’s training file. These files shall be maintained by the handler and Canine Unit coordinator.</p>
    <h4>318.12.4 TRAINING AIDS</h4>
    <p>Training aids are required to effectively train and maintain the skills of canines. Officers possessing, using or transporting controlled substances or explosives for canine training purposes must comply with federal and state requirements regarding the same. Alternatively, the Metro Transit Police Department may work with outside trainers with the applicable licenses or permits.</p>
    <h4>318.12.5 CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE TRAINING AIDS</h4>
    <p>Officers acting in the performance of their official duties may possess or transfer controlled substances for the purpose of narcotics-detection canine training in compliance with federal laws and if they comply with applicable state requirements (21 USC § 823(f)).</p>
    <p>The Chief of Police or the authorized designee may authorize a member to seek a court order to allow controlled substances seized by the Metro Transit Police Department to be possessed by the member or a narcotics-detection canine trainer who is working under the direction of this department for training purposes provided the controlled substances are no longer needed as criminal evidence.</p>
    <p>As an alternative, the Chief of Police or the authorized designee may request narcotics training aids from another law enforcement agency.</p>
    <p>These procedures are not required if the canine handler uses commercially available synthetic substances that are not controlled narcotics.</p>
    <h4>318.12.6 CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE PROCEDURES</h4>
    <p>Due to the responsibilities and liabilities involved with possessing readily usable amounts of controlled substances and the ever-present danger of the canine’s accidental ingestion of these controlled substances, the following procedures shall be strictly followed:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>All controlled substance training samples shall be weighed and tested prior to dispensing to the individual canine handler or trainer.</li>
        <li>The weight and test results shall be recorded and maintained by the Canine Unit coordinator.</li>
        <li>Any person possessing controlled substance training samples pursuant to court order or DEA registration shall maintain custody and control of the controlled substances and shall keep records regarding any loss of, or damage to, those controlled substances.</li>
        <li>All controlled substance training samples will be inspected, weighed and tested quarterly. The results of the quarterly testing shall be recorded and maintained by the canine coordinator with a copy forwarded to the dispensing agency.</li>
        <li>All controlled substance training samples will be stored in locked, airtight and watertight cases at all times except during training. The locked cases shall be secured in the trunk of the canine handler’s assigned patrol vehicle during transport and stored in an appropriate locked container. There are no exceptions to this procedure.</li>
        <li>The canine coordinator shall periodically inspect every controlled substance training sample for damage or tampering and take any appropriate action.</li>
        <li>Any unusable controlled substance training samples shall be returned to the Property and Evidence or to the dispensing agency.</li>
        <li>All controlled substance training samples shall be returned to the dispensing agency upon the conclusion of the training or upon demand by the dispensing agency.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>318.12.7 EXPLOSIVE TRAINING AIDS</h4>
    <p>Officers may possess, transport, store or use explosives or destructive devices in compliance with state and federal laws (Minn. Stat. § 609.668, Subd. 3(a)(1)); 18 USC § 842; 27 CFR 555.41).</p>
    <p>Explosive training aids designed specifically for canine teams should be used whenever reasonably feasible. Due to the safety concerns in the handling and transportation of explosives, inert or non-hazardous training aids should be employed whenever feasible. The use of explosives or destructive devices for training aids by canine teams is subject to the following:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>All explosive training aids when not in use shall be properly stored in a secure facility appropriate for the type of materials.</li>
        <li>An inventory ledger shall be maintained to document the type and quantity of explosive training aids that are stored.</li>
        <li>The canine coordinator shall be responsible to verify the explosive training aids on hand against the inventory ledger once each quarter.</li>
        <li>Only members of the canine team shall have access to the explosive training aids storage facility.</li>
        <li>A primary and secondary custodian will be designated to minimize the possibility of loss of explosive training aids during and after the training. Generally the handler will be designated as the primary custodian while the trainer or authorized second person on-scene will be designated as the secondary custodian.</li>
        <li>Any lost or damaged explosive training aids shall be promptly reported to the canine coordinator who will determine if any further action will be necessary. Any loss of explosives will be reported to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF).</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>320 - Domestic Abuse</h2>
    <h3>320.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this policy is to provide the guidelines necessary to deter, prevent and reduce domestic abuse through vigorous enforcement and to address domestic abuse as a serious crime against society. The policy specifically addresses the commitment of this department to take enforcement action when appropriate, to provide assistance to victims and to guide officers in the investigation of domestic abuse.</p>
    <h4>320.1.1 DEFINITIONS</h4>
    <p>Definitions related to this policy include:</p>
    <p><strong>Court order</strong> - All forms of orders related to domestic abuse, that have been issued by a court of this state or another, whether civil or criminal, regardless of whether service has been made.</p>
    <p><strong>Domestic abuse</strong> - Commission of any of the following if committed against a family or household member by another family or household member (Minn. Stat. § 518B.01 Subd. 2):</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Actual or fear of imminent physical harm, bodily injury, or assault</li>
        <li>Terroristic threats (Minn. Stat. § 609.713)</li>
        <li>Criminal sexual conduct (Minn. Stat. § 609.342 to Minn. Stat. § 609.3451)</li>
        <li>Interference with an emergency call (Minn. Stat. § 609.78)</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>320.2 POLICY</h3>
    <p>The Metro Transit Police Department's response to incidents of domestic abuse and violations of related court orders shall stress enforcement of the law to protect the victim and shall communicate the philosophy that domestic abuse is criminal behavior. It is also the policy of this department to facilitate victims' and offenders' access to appropriate civil remedies and community resources whenever feasible.</p>

    <h3>320.3 OFFICER SAFETY</h3>
    <p>The investigation of domestic abuse cases often places officers in emotionally charged and sometimes highly dangerous environments. No provision of this policy is intended to supersede the responsibility of all officers to exercise due caution and reasonable care in providing for the safety of any officers and parties involved.</p>

    <h3>INVESTIGATIONS</h3>
    <p>The following guidelines should be followed by officers when investigating domestic abuse cases:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Calls of reported, threatened, imminent or ongoing domestic abuse and the violation of any court order are of extreme importance and should be considered among the highest response priorities. This includes incomplete 9-1-1 calls.</li>
        <li>When practicable, officers should obtain and document statements from the victim, the suspect and any witnesses, including children, in or around the household or location of occurrence.</li>
        <li>Officers should list the full name and date of birth (and school if available) of each child who was present in the household at the time of the offense. The names of other children who may not have been in the house at that particular time should also be obtained for follow-up.</li>
        <li>When practicable and legally permitted, video or audio record all significant statements and observations.</li>
        <li>All injuries should be photographed, regardless of severity, taking care to preserve the victim's personal privacy. Where practicable, photographs should be taken by a person of the same sex. Victims whose injuries are not visible at the time of the incident should be asked to contact the Investigation Division in the event that the injuries later become visible.</li>
        <li>Officers should request that the victim complete and sign an authorization for release of medical records related to the incident when applicable.</li>
        <li>If the suspect is no longer at the scene, officers should make reasonable efforts to locate the suspect to further the investigation, provide the suspect with an opportunity to make a statement and make an arrest or seek an arrest warrant if appropriate.</li>
        <li>Seize any firearms or other dangerous weapons in the home, if appropriate and legally permitted, for safekeeping or as evidence.</li>
        <li>When completing an incident or arrest report for violation of a court order, officers should include specific information that establishes that the offender has been served, including the date the offender was served, the name of the agency that served the order and the provision of the order that the subject is alleged to have violated. When reasonably available, the arresting officer should attach a copy of the order to the incident or arrest report.</li>
        <li>Officers should take appropriate enforcement action when there is probable cause to believe an offense has occurred. Factors that should not be used as sole justification for declining to take enforcement action include:
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>Marital status of suspect and victim.</li>
                <li>Whether the suspect lives on the premises with the victim.</li>
                <li>Claims by the suspect that the victim provoked or perpetuated the violence.</li>
                <li>The potential financial or child custody consequences of arrest.</li>
                <li>The physical or emotional state of either party.</li>
                <li>Use of drugs or alcohol by either party.</li>
                <li>Denial that the abuse occurred where evidence indicates otherwise.</li>
                <li>A request by the victim not to arrest the suspect.</li>
                <li>Location of the incident (public/private).</li>
                <li>Speculation that the complainant may not follow through with the prosecution.</li>
                <li>The racial, cultural, social, professional position or sexual orientation of the victim or suspect.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>320.4.1 IF A SUSPECT IS ARRESTED</h4>
    <p>If a suspect is arrested, officers should:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Advise the victim that there is no guarantee the suspect will remain in custody.</li>
        <li>Provide the victim’s contact information to the jail staff to enable notification of the victim upon the suspect’s release from jail (Minn. Stat. § 629.72 Subd. 6).</li>
        <li>Advise the victim whether any type of court order will be in effect when the suspect is released from jail.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>320.4.2 IF NO ARREST IS MADE</h4>
    <p>If no arrest is made, the officer should:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Advise the parties of any options, including but not limited to:
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>Voluntary separation of the parties.</li>
                <li>Appropriate resource referrals (e.g., counselors, friends, relatives, shelter homes, victim witness unit).</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Document the resolution in a report.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>320.5 VICTIM ASSISTANCE</h3>
    <p>Victims may be traumatized or confused. Officers should:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Recognize that a victim's behavior and actions may be affected.</li>
        <li>Provide the victim with the department's domestic abuse information handout, even if the incident may not rise to the level of a crime.</li>
        <li>Alert the victim to any available victim advocates, shelters and community resources.</li>
        <li>Stand by for a reasonable amount of time when an involved person requests law enforcement assistance while removing essential items of personal property.</li>
        <li>Seek medical assistance as soon as practicable for the victim if he/she has sustained injury or complains of pain.</li>
        <li>Ask the victim whether he/she has a safe place to stay. Assist in arranging to transport the victim to an alternate shelter if the victim expresses a concern for his/her safety or if the officer determines that a need exists.</li>
        <li>Make reasonable efforts to ensure that children or dependent adults who are under the supervision of the suspect or victim are being properly cared for.</li>
        <li>Seek or assist the victim in obtaining an emergency order if appropriate.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>320.6 DISPATCH ASSISTANCE</h4>
    <p>All calls of domestic abuse, including incomplete 9-1-1 calls, should be dispatched as soon as practicable.</p>
    <p>Dispatchers are not required to verify the validity of a court order before responding to a request for assistance. Officers should request that dispatchers check whether any of the involved persons are subject to the terms of a court order.</p>

    <h3>320.7 FOREIGN COURT ORDERS</h3>
    <p>Various types of orders may be issued in domestic abuse cases. Any foreign court order properly issued by a court of another state, Indian tribe or territory shall be enforced by officers as if it were the order of a court in this state. An order should be considered properly issued when it reasonably appears that the issuing court has jurisdiction over the parties and reasonable notice and opportunity to respond was given to the party against whom the order was issued (18 USC</p>
    <p>§ 2265). An otherwise valid out-of-state court order shall be enforced, regardless of whether the order has been properly registered with this state.</p>

    <h3>320.8 VERIFICATION OF COURT ORDERS</h3>
    <p>Determining the validity of a court order, particularly an order from another jurisdiction, can be challenging. Therefore, in determining whether there is probable cause to make an arrest for a violation of any court order, officers should carefully review the actual order when available, and, where appropriate and practicable:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Ask the subject of the order about his/her notice or receipt of the order, his/her knowledge of its terms and efforts to respond to the order.</li>
        <li>Check available records or databases that may show the status or conditions of the order.</li>
        <li>Contact the issuing court to verify the validity of the order.</li>
        <li>Contact a law enforcement official from the jurisdiction where the order was issued to verify information.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Officers should document in an appropriate report their efforts to verify the validity of an order, regardless of whether an arrest is made. Officers should contact a supervisor for clarification when needed.</p>

    <h3>320.9 LEGAL MANDATES AND RELEVANT LAWS</h3>
    <p>Minnesota law provides for the following:</p>
    <h4>320.9.1 STANDARDS FOR ARRESTS</h4>
    <p>Officers investigating a domestic abuse report should consider the following:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>An officer has the authority to arrest a person without a warrant, including at the person’s residence, if the peace officer has probable cause to believe that the person has, within the preceding 72 hours, exclusive of the day probable cause was established, assaulted, threatened with a dangerous weapon or placed in fear of immediate bodily harm any person covered by the “family or household member” definition, even if the assault did not rise to the level of a felony or did not take place in the presence of the peace officer (Minn. Stat. § 629.34; Minn. Stat. § 629.341).</li>
        <li>Officers should generally not make dual arrests but may make an arrest of a primary aggressor. Where there are allegations that each party assaulted the other, the officer shall determine whether there is sufficient evidence to conclude that one of the parties was the primary aggressor based on the following criteria and the officer’s judgment (Minn. Stat. § 629.342, Subd. 2):
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>Comparative extent of any injuries inflicted</li>
                <li>Fear of physical injury because of past or present threats</li>
                <li>Actions taken in self-defense or to protect oneself</li>
                <li>History of domestic abuse perpetrated by one party against the other</li>
                <li>Existence or previous existence of an order for protection</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>An officer shall not issue a citation in lieu of arrest and detention to an individual charged with any of the following offenses (Minn. Stat. § 629.72):
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>Stalking</li>
                <li>Domestic abuse</li>
                <li>Violation of an order for protection</li>
                <li>Violation of a domestic abuse no contact order</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>The Shift Supervisor will determine whether a person arrested on a charge of stalking any person, domestic abuse, violation of an order for protection, violation of a domestic abuse no contact order or violation of a court-ordered transfer of firearms will be held in custody or be issued a citation in lieu of continued detention and released after booking. The person shall be held in custody whenever the Shift Supervisor determines that it reasonably appears the release of the person (Minn. Stat. § 629.72):
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>Poses a threat to the alleged victim or another family or household member.</li>
                <li>Poses a threat to public safety.</li>
                <li>Involves a substantial likelihood that the arrested person will fail to appear at subsequent proceedings.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Officers shall arrest and take into custody, without a warrant, a person whom the peace officer has probable cause to believe has violated a court order issued pursuant to Minn.<br/><br/>
        Stat. § 518B.01 or Minn. Stat. § 629.75. Such an arrest shall be made even if the violation of the order did not take place in the presence of the peace officer, if the officer can verify the existence of the order. If the person is not released on citation in lieu of continuing detention, the person shall be held in custody for these violations for at least 36 hours unless released by a court (Minn. Stat. § 518B.01; Minn. Stat. § 629.75).</li>
        <li>An arrest for a violation of an order of protection may be made regardless of whether the excluded party was invited back to the residence (Minn. Stat. § 518B.01, Subd. 18).</li>
        <li>Following an arrest, an officer should contact the local domestic abuse program by phone as soon as possible and provide the name and address of the victim and a brief factual account of events associated with the action.</li>
        <li>An officer shall arrest and take into custody a person whom the officer has probable cause to believe has violated a harassment restraining order, pursuant to Minn. Stat. § 609.748.</li>
        <li>Officers are authorized to make an arrest without a warrant when there is probable cause to believe the person has violated the provisions of any other no contact or restraining order issued by a court, even if the offense did not rise to the level of a felony (Minn. Stat. § 629.34). While conducting a domestic abuse investigation officers shall attempt to verify whether there has been a court order issued.</li>
        <li>Officers should consider whether other offenses have been committed that may not qualify as a domestic abuse including, but not limited to, burglary, felony assault, terroristic threats, kidnapping, false imprisonment, witness tampering, trespassing, criminal damage to property, disorderly conduct or assault.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>320.9.2 REPORTS AND RECORDS</h4>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Officers should include information related to the following in a report, as applicable (Minn. Stat. § 629.341):
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>Names, addresses, telephone numbers of all involved persons</li>
                <li>Condition of clothing</li>
                <li>Description of the scene, including any property damage</li>
                <li>Evidence of physical injury, including strangulation</li>

                <li>A detailed explanation of the reasons for the officer’s decision not to arrest or seek an arrest warrant</li>
                <li>Evidence of any prior domestic abuse, related convictions, including dates</li>

            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Domestic abuse reports should be forwarded to the appropriate prosecutor for review and consideration of criminal charges, even when no arrest is made or warrant requested.</li>
        <li>If a child was present at the scene of a domestic abuse incident or was the victim of domestic abuse, the officer should determine whether the child has been subjected to physical abuse, sexual abuse or neglect, and comply with the mandatory reporting requirements of Minn. Stat. § 626.556.</p>
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>The officer shall also attempt to verify whether there has been an order for protection issued under Minn. Stat. § 260C.201 and take appropriate action.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Fees will not be charged for the release of reports related to domestic abuse, as directed in Minn. Stat. § 13.82.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>320.9.3 SERVICE OF COURT ORDERS</h3>
    <p>Officers, when reasonably safe and in a position to do so, shall serve copies or short forms of court orders as directed in Minn. Stat. § 518B.01.</p>
    <h4>320.9.4 COURT-ORDERED FIREARM SURRENDERS</h4>
    <p>Although not required, this department generally will accept firearms surrendered by a court order from an abusing party or defendant. A decision to refuse a surrendered firearm should be approved by a supervisor.</p>
    <p>Firearms will normally be surrendered at the Metro Transit Police Department; however, when encountering someone in the field who wishes to surrender a firearm, officers should make reasonable efforts to accommodate the request.</p>
    <p>Surrendered firearms should be collected and submitted to the Property and Evidence in accordance with the Property and Evidence Policy.</p>
