    <h2>Chief's Preface</h2>
    <p>This Metro Transit Police Department policy manual has been developed to provide the framework to guide you in the performance of our law enforcement mission. These policies have been established as a result of an ever-changing assimilation of legal and best-practice principles in the law enforcement profession. This manual, together with your training and your professional discretion, will provide you the tools to carry out your responsibilities.</p>
    <p>All personnel are required to be familiar with the directives in this manual and, when necessary, seek guidance from a supervisor. Department members are encouraged to submit recommendations for constructive changes to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of our operations. This manual will be updated as necessary to reflect changes in the law, best practices, personnel responsibilities as well as department goals and objectives.</p>
</div>

            <div class="chapter" id="law-enforcement-code-of-ethics">
    <h2>Law Enforcement Code of Ethics</h2>
    <p>As a law enforcement officer, my fundamental duty is to serve the community; to safeguard lives and property; to protect the innocent against deception, the weak against oppression or intimidation and the peaceful against abuse or disorder; and to respect the constitutional rights of all to liberty, equality and justice.</p>
    <p>I will keep my private life unsullied as an example to all and will behave in a manner that does not bring discredit to me or to my agency. I will maintain courageous calm in the face of danger, scorn or ridicule; develop self-restraint; and be constantly mindful of the welfare of others. Honest in thought and deed both in my personal and official life, I will be exemplary in obeying the law and the regulations of my department. Whatever I see or hear of a confidential nature or that is confided to me in my official capacity will be kept ever secret unless revelation is necessary in the performance of my duty.</p>
    <p>I will never act officiously or permit personal feelings, prejudices, political beliefs, aspirations, animosities or friendships to influence my decisions. With no compromise for crime and with relentless prosecution of criminals, I will enforce the law courteously and appropriately without fear or favor, malice or ill will, never employing unnecessary force or abuse and never accepting gratuities.</p>
    <p>I recognize the badge of my office as a symbol of public faith, and I accept it as a public trust to be held so long as I am true to the ethics of police service. I will never engage in acts of corruption or bribery, nor will I condone such acts by other police officers. I will cooperate with all legally authorized agencies and their representatives in the pursuit of justice.</p>
    <p>I know that I alone am responsible for my own standard of professional performance and will take every reasonable opportunity to enhance and improve my level of knowledge and competence.</p>

    <h4>100.2.2 ARREST AUTHORITY OUTSIDE THE JURISDICTION OF THE METRO TRANSIT POLICE DEPARTMENT</h4>

The recommendation should not identify specific facts of any incidents, such as identities of employees involved or the date, time and location of the incident, but should focus on the type of training being recommended.</p>
    <p>The Training Coordinator will consider the recommendations of the committee and determine what training should be addressed, taking into consideration the mission of the Department and available resources.</p>

    <h3>208.7 TRAINING RECORDS</h3>
    <p>The Training Coordinator is responsible for the creation, filing and storage of all training records in compliance with POST standards. Training records shall be retained as long as the employee's personnel file is retained.</p>

    <h3>208.8 REPORTING TRAINING TO POST</h3>
    <p>The POST Board distributes license renewals directly to licensed peace officers and requires the licensee to report completed continuing education courses from the previous license period. Officers are responsible for responding to these requests in a timely manner and otherwise maintaining their licensed status.</p>

    <h3>208.9 DAILY TRAINING BULLETINS</h3>
    <p>The Lexipol Daily Training Bulletins (DTBs) are contained in a web-accessed system that provides training on the Metro Transit Police Department policy manual and other important topics. Generally, one training bulletin is available for each day of the month. However, the number of DTBs may be adjusted by the Training Coordinator.</p>
    <p>Personnel assigned to participate in DTBs shall only use login credentials assigned to them by the Training Coordinator or designee. Personnel should not share their password with others and should frequently change their password to protect the security of the system. After each session, employees should logoff the system to prevent unauthorized access. The content of the DTBs is copyrighted material and shall not be shared with others outside of the Department.</p>
    <p>Employees who are assigned to participate in the DTB program should complete each DTB at the beginning of their shift, or as otherwise directed by their supervisor. Employees should not allow uncompleted DTBs to build up over time. Personnel may be required to complete DTBs missed during extended absences (e.g., vacation, medical leave) upon returning to duty. Although the DTB system can be accessed from any Internet active computer, employees shall only take DTBs as part of their on-duty assignment unless directed otherwise by a supervisor.</p>
    <p>The Training Coordinator will be responsible for monitoring the progress of personnel to ensure compliance with this policy.</p>

    <h3>208.10 CLASSROOM DISCRIMINATION</h3>
    <p>The Training Coordinator shall ensure that procedures for the investigation and resolution of allegations of classroom discrimination are developed and implemented, and include the required elements (Minn. R. 6700.0900; Minn. R. 6700.0902).</p>

    <h2>212 - Electronic Mail</h2>
    <h3>212.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this policy is to establish guidelines for the proper use and application of the electronic mail (email) system provided by the Department / Metropolitan Council. Email is a communication tool available to employees to enhance efficiency in the performance of job duties. It is to be used in accordance with generally accepted business practices, Metropolitan Council policy and current law (e.g., Minnesota Data Practices Act). Messages transmitted over the email system must only be those that involve official business activities or contain information essential to employees for the accomplishment of business-related tasks and/or communication directly related to the business, administration or practices of the Department.</p>

    <h3>212.2 EMAIL RIGHT OF PRIVACY</h3>
    <p>All email messages, including attachments, transmitted over the Department / Metropolitan Council computer network or accessed through a web browser accessing the Department / Metropolitan Council system are considered Department / Metropolitan Council records and, therefore, are the property of the Department / Metropolitan Council. The Department / Metropolitan Council has the right to access, audit and disclose for whatever reason, all messages, including attachments, transmitted or received through its email system or placed into its storage.</p>
    <p>Unless it is encrypted, the email system is not a confidential system since all communications transmitted on, to or from the system are the property of the Department / Metropolitan Council. Therefore, the email system is not appropriate for confidential or personal communication. If a communication must be private, an alternative method to communicate the message should be used instead of email. Employees using the Department / Metropolitan Council email system shall have no expectation of privacy concerning communications utilizing the system.</p>

    <h3>212.3 PROHIBITED USE OF EMAIL</h3>
    <p>The Department / Metropolitan Council email system shall not be used for personal purposes unless that use is authorized in writing by the Chief of Police.</p>
    <p>Sending derogatory, defamatory, obscene, disrespectful, sexually suggestive and harassing or any other inappropriate messages on the email system is prohibited, will constitute just cause for discipline, and will result in discipline, up to and including termination of employment</p>
    <p>Email messages addressed to the entire department are only to be used for official business- related items that are of particular interest to all users and must be approved by the Chief of Police or designee. Personal advertisements or announcements are not permitted.</p>
    <p>It is a violation of this policy to transmit a message under another user's name or email address or to use the password of another to log onto the system. Users are required to log off the network or lock the workstation when their computer is unattended. This added security measure would minimize the misuse of an individual's email, name and/or password.</p>

    <h3>212.4 EMAIL RECORD MANAGEMENT</h3>
    <p>Email may, depending upon the individual content, be a public record under the Minnesota Data Practices Act and must be managed in accordance with the established records retention schedule and in compliance with state law.</p>
    <p>The Custodian of Records shall ensure that email messages are retained and recoverable as outlined in the Records Maintenance and Release Policy.</p>

            <div class="chapter" id="300">
    <h2>300 - Use of Force</h2>
    <h3>300.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>This policy provides guidelines on the reasonable use of force. While there is no way to specify the exact amount or type of reasonable force to be applied in any situation, every member of this department is expected to use these guidelines to make such decisions in a professional, impartial and reasonable manner.</p>
    <h4>300.1.1 DEFINITIONS</h4>
    <p>Definitions related to this policy include:</p>
    <p><strong>Deadly force</strong> - Force reasonably anticipated and intended to create a substantial likelihood of causing death or very serious injury.</p>
    <p><strong>Force</strong> - The application of physical techniques or tactics, chemical agents or weapons to another person. It is not a use of force when a person allows him/herself to be searched, escorted, handcuffed or restrained.</p>

    <h3>300.2 POLICY</h3>
    <p>The use of force by law enforcement personnel is a matter of critical concern, both to the public and to the law enforcement community. Officers are involved on a daily basis in numerous and varied interactions and, when warranted, may use reasonable force in carrying out their duties.</p>
    <p>Officers must have an understanding of, and true appreciation for, their authority and limitations. This is especially true with respect to overcoming resistance while engaged in the performance of law enforcement duties.</p>
    <p>The Department recognizes and respects the value of all human life and dignity without prejudice to anyone. Vesting officers with the authority to use reasonable force and to protect the public welfare requires monitoring, evaluation and a careful balancing of all interests.</p>
    <h4>300.2.1 DUTY TO INTERCEDE</h3>
    <p>Any officer present and observing another officer using force that is clearly beyond that which is objectively reasonable under the circumstances shall, when in a position to do so, intercede to prevent the use of unreasonable force. An officer who observes another employee use force that exceeds the degree of force permitted by law should promptly report these observations to a supervisor.</p>

    <h3>300.3 USE OF FORCE</h3>
    <p>Officers shall use only that amount of force that reasonably appears necessary given the facts and circumstances perceived by the officer at the time of the event to accomplish a legitimate law enforcement purpose. Officers are encouraged to use de-escalation when/if the facts and circumstances are deemed reasonable.</p>
    <p>The reasonableness of force will be judged from the perspective of a reasonable officer on the scene at the time of the incident. Any evaluation of reasonableness must allow for the fact that</p>
    <p>officers are often forced to make split-second decisions about the amount of force that reasonably appears necessary in a particular situation, with limited information and in circumstances that are tense, uncertain and rapidly evolving.</p>
    <p>Given that no policy can realistically predict every possible situation an officer might encounter, officers are entrusted to use well-reasoned discretion in determining the appropriate use of force in each incident.</p>
    <p>It is also recognized that circumstances may arise in which officers reasonably believe that it would be impractical or ineffective to use any of the tools, weapons or methods provided by the Department. Officers may find it more effective or reasonable to improvise their response to rapidly unfolding conditions that they are confronting. In such circumstances, the use of any improvised device or method must nonetheless be reasonable and utilized only to the degree that reasonably appears necessary to accomplish a legitimate law enforcement purpose.</p>
    <p>While the ultimate objective of every law enforcement encounter is to avoid or minimize injury, nothing in this policy requires an officer to retreat or be exposed to possible physical injury before applying reasonable force.</p>
    <h4>300.3.1 USE OF FORCE TO EFFECT AN ARREST</h4>
    <p>An officer may use reasonable force (Minn. Stat. § 609.06 and Minn. Stat. § 629.33):</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>In effecting a lawful arrest.</li>
        <li>In the execution of a legal process.</li>
        <li>In enforcing an order of the court.</li>
        <li>In executing any other duty imposed by law.</li>
        <li>In preventing the escape, or to retake following the escape, of a person lawfully held on a charge or conviction of a crime.</li>
        <li>In restraining a person with a mental illness or a person with a developmental disability from self-injury or injury to another.</li>
        <li>In self defense or defense of another.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>An officer who makes or attempts to make an arrest need not retreat or desist from his/her efforts by reason of resistance or threatened resistance of the person being arrested; nor shall such officer be deemed the aggressor or lose his/her right to self-defense by the use of reasonable force to effect the arrest or to prevent escape or to overcome resistance.</p>
    <h4>300.3.2 FACTORS USED TO DETERMINE THE REASONABLENESS OF FORCE</h4>
    <p>When determining whether to apply force and evaluating whether an officer has used reasonable force, a number of factors should be taken into consideration, as time and circumstances permit. These factors include, but are not limited to:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Immediacy and severity of the threat to officers or others.</li>
        <li>The conduct of the individual being confronted, as reasonably perceived by the officer at the time.</li>
        <li>Officer/subject factors (age, size, relative strength, skill level, injuries sustained, level of exhaustion or fatigue, the number of officers available vs. subjects).</li>
        <li>The effects of drugs or alcohol.</li>
        <li>Subject’s mental state or capacity.</li>
        <li>Proximity of weapons or dangerous improvised devices.</li>
        <li>The degree to which the subject has been effectively restrained and his/her ability to resist despite being restrained.</li>
        <li>The availability of other options and their possible effectiveness.</li>
        <li>Seriousness of the suspected offense or reason for contact with the individual.</li>
        <li>Training and experience of the officer.</li>
        <li>Potential for injury to officers, suspects and others.</li>
        <li>Whether the person appears to be resisting, attempting to evade arrest by flight or is attacking the officer.</li>
        <li>The risk and reasonably foreseeable consequences of escape.</li>
        <li>The apparent need for immediate control of the subject or a prompt resolution of the situation.</li>
        <li>Whether the conduct of the individual being confronted no longer reasonably appears to pose an imminent threat to the officer or others.</li>
        <li>Prior contacts with the subject or awareness of any propensity for violence.</li>
        <li>Any other exigent circumstances.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>300.3.3 PAIN COMPLIANCE TECHNIQUES</h4>
    <p>Pain compliance techniques may be effective in controlling a physically or actively resisting individual. Officers may only apply those pain compliance techniques for which they have successfully completed department-approved training. Officers utilizing any pain compliance technique should consider:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>The degree to which the application of the technique may be controlled given the level of resistance.</li>
        <li>Whether the person can comply with the direction or orders of the officer.</li>
        <li>Whether the person has been given sufficient opportunity to comply.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The application of any pain compliance technique shall be discontinued once the officer determines that compliance has been achieved.</p>
    <h4>300.3.4 CAROTID CONTROL</h4>
    <p>The proper application of the carotid control hold may be effective in restraining a violent or combative individual. However, due to the potential for injury, the use of the carotid control hold is subject to the following:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>The officer shall have successfully completed department-approved training in the use and application of the carotid control hold.</li>
        <li>The carotid control hold may only be used when circumstances perceived by the officer at the time indicate that such application reasonably appears necessary to control a person in any of the following circumstances:</p>
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>The subject is violent or physically resisting.</li>
                <li>The subject, by words or actions, has demonstrated an intention to be violent and reasonably appears to have the potential to harm officers, him/herself or others.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>The application of a carotid control hold on the following individuals should generally be avoided unless the totality of the circumstances indicates that other available options reasonably appear ineffective, or would present a greater danger to the officer, the subject or others, and the officer reasonably believes that the need to control the individual outweighs the risk of applying a carotid control hold:</p>
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>Females who are known to be pregnant</li>
                <li>Elderly individuals</li>
                <li>Obvious juveniles</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Any individual who has had the carotid control hold applied, and he/she was rendered unconscious, shall be promptly examined by paramedics or other qualified medical personnel and should be monitored until examined by paramedics or other appropriate medical personnel.</li>
        <li>The officer shall inform any person receiving custody, or any person placed in a position of providing care, that the individual has been subjected to the carotid control hold and whether the subject lost consciousness as a result.</li>
        <li>Any officer attempting or applying the carotid control hold shall promptly notify a supervisor of the use or attempted use of such hold.</li>
        <li>The use or attempted use of the carotid control hold shall be thoroughly documented by the officer in any related reports.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>A carotid control hold (or vascular neck restraint) is different from a "choke" hold. Vascular compression affects veins and arteries whereas a "choke" compresses the airway, windpipe or throat etc. A "choke" hold is considered deadly force.</p>

    <h3>300.4 DEADLY FORCE</h3>
    <p>Use of deadly force is justified in the following circumstances:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>An officer may use deadly force to protect him/herself or others from what he/she reasonably believes would be an imminent threat of death or serious bodily injury.</li>
        <li>An officer may use deadly force to stop a fleeing subject when the officer has probable cause to believe that the person has committed, or intends to commit, a felony involving the infliction or threatened infliction of serious bodily injury or death, and the officer reasonably believes that there is an imminent risk of serious bodily injury or death to any other person if the subject is not immediately apprehended. Under such circumstances, a verbal warning should precede the use of deadly force, where feasible.<br/><br/>
        Imminent does not mean immediate or instantaneous. An imminent danger may exist even if the suspect is not at that very moment pointing a weapon at someone. For example, an imminent danger may exist if an officer reasonably believes any of the following:
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>The person has a weapon or is attempting to access one and it is reasonable to believe the person intends to use it against the officer or another.</li>
                <li>The person is capable of causing serious bodily injury or death without a weapon and it is reasonable to believe the person intends to do so.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>300.4.1 SHOOTING AT OR FROM MOVING VEHICLES</h4>
    <p>Shots fired at or from a moving vehicle are rarely effective. Officers should move out of the path of an approaching vehicle instead of discharging their firearm at the vehicle or any of its occupants. An officer should only discharge a firearm at a moving vehicle or its occupants when the officer reasonably believes there are no other reasonable means available to avert the threat of the vehicle, or if deadly force other than the vehicle is directed at the officer or others.</p>
    <p>Officers should not shoot at any part of a vehicle in an attempt to disable the vehicle.</p>

    <h3>300.5 REPORTING THE USE OF FORCE</h3>
    <p>Any use of force by a member of this department shall be documented promptly, completely and accurately in an appropriate report, depending on the nature of the incident. The officer should articulate the factors perceived and why he/she believed the use of force was reasonable under the circumstances. To collect data for purposes of training, resource allocation, analysis and related purposes, the Department may require the completion of additional report forms, as specified in department policy, procedure or law.</p>
    <h4>300.5.1 NOTIFICATION TO SUPERVISORS</h4>
    <p>Supervisory notification shall be made as soon as practicable following the application of force in any of the following circumstances:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>The application caused a visible injury.</li>
        <li>The application would lead a reasonable officer to conclude that the individual may have experienced more than momentary discomfort.</li>
        <li>The individual subjected to the force complained of injury or continuing pain.</li>
        <li>The individual indicates intent to pursue litigation.</li>
        <li>Any application of an Conducted Energy Device (CED) or control device.</li>
        <li>Any application of a restraint device other than handcuffs, shackles or belly chains.</li>
        <li>The individual subjected to the force was rendered unconscious.</li>
        <li>An individual was struck or kicked.</li>
        <li>An individual alleges any of the above has occurred.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>300.6 MEDICAL CONSIDERATION</h3>
    <p>Prior to booking or release, medical assistance shall be obtained for any person who exhibits signs of physical distress, who has sustained visible injury, expresses a complaint of injury or continuing pain, or who was rendered unconscious. Any individual exhibiting signs of physical distress after an encounter should be continuously monitored until he/she can be medically assessed.</p>
    <p>Based upon the officer’s initial assessment of the nature and extent of the subject’s injuries, medical assistance may consist of examination by fire personnel, paramedics, hospital staff or medical staff at the jail. If any such individual refuses medical attention, such a refusal shall be fully documented in related reports and, whenever practicable, should be witnessed by another officer and/or medical personnel. If a recording is made of the contact or an interview with the individual, any refusal should be included in the recording, if possible.</p>
    <p>The on-scene supervisor, or if not available, the primary handling officer shall ensure that any person providing medical care or receiving custody of a person following any use of force is informed that the person was subjected to force. This notification shall include a description of the force used and any other circumstances the officer reasonably believes would be potential safety or medical risks to the subject (e.g., prolonged struggle, extreme agitation, impaired respiration).</p>
    <p>Persons who exhibit extreme agitation, violent irrational behavior accompanied by profuse sweating, extraordinary strength beyond their physical characteristics and imperviousness to pain (sometimes called “excited delirium”), or who require a protracted physical encounter with multiple officers to be brought under control, may be at an increased risk of sudden death. Calls involving these persons should be considered medical emergencies. Officers who reasonably suspect a medical emergency should request medical assistance as soon as practicable and have medical personnel stage away if appropriate.</p>

    <h3>300.7 SUPERVISOR RESPONSIBILITY</h3>
    <p>When a supervisor is able to respond to an incident in which there has been a reported application of force, the supervisor is expected to:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Obtain the basic facts from the involved officers. Absent an allegation of misconduct or excessive force, this will be considered a routine contact in the normal course of duties.</li>
        <li>Ensure that any injured parties are examined and treated.</li>
        <li>When possible, separately obtain a recorded interview with the subject upon whom force was applied. The fact that a recorded interview was conducted should be documented in a report and the recording should be retained until all potential for civil litigation has expired.</li>
        <li>Once any initial medical assessment has been completed or first aid has been rendered, ensure that photographs have been taken of any areas involving visible injury or complaint of pain, as well as overall photographs of uninjured areas. These photographs should be retained until all potential for civil litigation has expired.</li>
        <li>Identify any witnesses not already included in related reports.</li>
        <li>Review and approve all related reports.</li>
        <li>Determine if there is any indication that the subject may pursue civil litigation.</p>
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>If there is an indication of potential civil litigation, the supervisor should complete and route a notification of a potential claim through the appropriate channels.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Evaluate the circumstances surrounding the incident and initiate an administrative investigation if there is a question of policy non-compliance or if for any reason further investigation may be appropriate.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>In the event that a supervisor is unable to respond to the scene of an incident involving the reported application of force, the supervisor is still expected to complete as many of the above items as circumstances permit.</p>
    <h4>300.7.1 SHIFT SUPERVISOR RESPONSIBILITY</h4>
    <p>The Shift Supervisor shall review each use of force by any personnel within his/her command to ensure compliance with this policy and to address any training issues.</p>

    <h3>300.8 TRAINING</h3>
    <p>Officers will receive training on this policy, including the learning objectives as provided by POST, at least annually (Minn. Stat. § 626.8452, Subd. 3).</p>

    <h2>302 - Use of Force Review Boards</h2>
    <h3>302.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>This policy establishes a process for the Metro Transit Police Department to administratively review the use of force by its employees.</p>
    <p>The purpose of the Use of Force Review Board is to review such incidents and determine whether policy, training, weapon or equipment issues should be addressed. The Board shall only forward a report to the Chief of Police recommending policy changes, training needs, weapons or equipment upgrades.</p>

    <h3>302.2 POLICY</h3>
    <p>The Metro Transit Police Department will objectively evaluate the use of force by its members to ensure that their authority is used lawfully, appropriately and is consistent with training and policy.</p>

    <h3>302.3 REMOVAL FROM LINE DUTY ASSIGNMENTS</h3>
    <p>Generally, whenever an employee's actions or use of force in an official capacity, or while using department equipment, results in death or very serious injury to another, that employee will be placed in a temporary administrative assignment pending an administrative review. The Chief of Police may exercise discretion and choose not to place an employee in an administrative assignment in any case.</p>

    <h3>302.4 REVIEW BOARD</h3>
    <p>The Use of Force Review Board will meet on a quarterly basis or be convened as necessary to review the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Any incident where an officer discharges any firearm, on- or off-duty, including accidental discharges. This does not include firearms training, euthanizing injured animals or during legally recognized recreational activity.</li>
        <li>Any incident where an officer has had force used against them which has caused death, great bodily harm or serious injury.</li>
        <li>Any incident where the officer has used force which resulted in death, great bodily harm or serious injury.</li>
        <li>Any incident where an officer has been disarmed.</li>
        <li>Any other incident with an unusual occurrence and/or critical incident.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The Chief of Police may request the Use of Force Review Board to investigate the circumstances surrounding any use of force incident.</p>
    <h4>302.4.1 COMPOSITION OF THE BOARD</h4>
    <p>The Training Coordinator should select five Use of Force Review Board members from the following, as appropriate:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Representatives from each training discipline (e.g. Use of Force, Taser, Firearms etc)</li>
        <li>Non-administrative supervisor</li>
        <li>A peer officer</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The Training Coordinator will serve as chairperson on the Use of Force Review Board.</p>
    <h4>302.4.2 RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE BOARD</h4>
    <p>The Use of Force Review Board is empowered to conduct an administrative review and inquiry into the circumstances of an incident. This review will be separate and distinct from any investigation (criminal or internal) of the incident.</p>
    <p>The board does not have the authority to recommend discipline.</p>
    <p>The Chief of Police will determine whether the board should delay its review until after completion of any criminal investigation, review by any prosecutorial body, filing of criminal charges, the decision not to file criminal charges or any other action. The board should be provided all relevant available material from these proceedings for its consideration.</p>
    <p>The review shall be based upon those facts which were reasonably believed or known by the officer at the time of the incident, applying any legal requirements, department policies, procedures and approved training to those facts. Facts later discovered but unknown to the officer at the time shall neither justify nor call into question an officer's decision regarding the use of force.</p>
    <p>At the conclusion of any review, copies of all relevant reports and information will be gathered by the Training Coordinator, compiled into a written report and filed with the Chief of Police. The report shall be for the exclusive and sole use of the Chief of Police. The Chief of Police will determine how the report and recommendations are to be used.</p>

    <h2>306 - Handcuffing and Restraints</h2>
    <h3>306.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>This policy provides guidelines for the use of handcuffs and other restraints during detentions and arrests.</p>

    <h3>306.2 POLICY</h3>
    <p>The Metro Transit Police Department authorizes the use of restraint devices in accordance with this policy, the Use of Force Policy and department training. Restraint devices shall not be used to punish, to display authority or as a show of force.</p>

    <h3>306.3 USE OF RESTRAINTS</h3>
    <p>Only members who have successfully completed Metro Transit Police Department-approved training on the use of restraint devices described in this policy are authorized to use these devices.</p>
    <p>When deciding whether to use any restraint, officers should carefully balance officer safety concerns with factors that include, but are not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The circumstances or crime leading to the arrest.</li>
        <li>The demeanor and behavior of the arrested person.</li>
        <li>The age and health of the person.</li>
        <li>Whether the person is known to be pregnant.</li>
        <li>Whether the person has a hearing or speaking disability. In such cases, consideration should be given, safety permitting, to handcuffing to the front in order to allow the person to sign or write notes.</li>
        <li>Whether the person has any other apparent disability.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>306.3.1 RESTRAINT OF DETAINEES</h4>
    <p>Situations may arise where it may be reasonable to restrain an individual who may, after brief investigation, be released without arrest. Unless arrested, the use of restraints on detainees should continue only for as long as is reasonably necessary to assure the safety of officers and others. When deciding whether to remove restraints from a detainee, officers should continuously weigh the safety interests at hand against the continuing intrusion upon the detainee.</p>
    <h4>306.3.2 RESTRAINT OF PREGNANT PERSONS</h4>
    <p>Persons who are known to be pregnant should be restrained in the least restrictive manner that is effective for officer safety.</p>
    <p>No person who is in labor shall be handcuffed or restrained except in extraordinary circumstances and only when a supervisor makes an individualized determination that such restraints are necessary to prevent escape or injury.</p>
    <h4>306.3.3 RESTRAINT OF JUVENILES</h4>
    <p>A juvenile under 14 years of age should not be restrained unless he/she is suspected of a dangerous felony or when the officer has a reasonable suspicion that the juvenile may resist, attempt escape, injure him/herself, injure the officer or damage property.</p>
    <h4>306.3.4 NOTIFICATIONS</h4>
    <p>Whenever an officer transports a person with the use of restraints other than handcuffs, the officer shall inform the jail staff upon arrival at the jail that restraints were used. This notification should include information regarding any other circumstances the officer reasonably believes would be potential safety concerns or medical risks to the subject (e.g., prolonged struggle, extreme agitation, impaired respiration) that may have occurred prior to, or during transportation to the jail.</p>

    <h3>306.4 HANDCUFFS OR PLASTIC CUFFS</h3>
    <p>Handcuffs, including temporary nylon or plastic cuffs, may be used only to restrain a person's hands to ensure officer safety.</p>
    <p>Although recommended for most arrest situations, handcuffing is discretionary and not an absolute requirement of the Department. Officers should consider handcuffing any person they reasonably believe warrants that degree of restraint. However, officers should not conclude that in order to avoid risk every person should be handcuffed, regardless of the circumstances.</p>
    <p>In most situations handcuffs should be applied with the hands behind the person's back. When feasible, handcuffs should be double-locked to prevent tightening, which may cause undue discomfort or injury to the hands or wrists.</p>
    <p>In situations where one pair of handcuffs does not appear sufficient to restrain the individual or may cause unreasonable discomfort due to the person's size, officers should consider alternatives, such as using an additional set of handcuffs or multiple plastic cuffs.</p>
    <p>Handcuffs should be removed as soon as it is reasonable or after the person has been searched and is safely confined within a detention facility.</p>

    <h3>306.5 SPIT HOODS</h3>
    <p>Spit hoods/masks/socks are temporary protective devices designed to prevent the wearer from biting and/or transferring or transmitting fluids (saliva and mucous) to others.</p>
    <p>Spit hoods may be placed upon persons in custody when the officer reasonably believes the person will bite or spit, either on a person or in an inappropriate place. They are generally used during application of a physical restraint, while the person is restrained, or during or after transport.</p>
    <p>Officers utilizing spit hoods should ensure that the spit hood is fastened properly to allow for adequate ventilation and that the restrained person can breathe normally. Officers should provide assistance during the movement of restrained individuals due to the potential for impaired or distorted vision on the part of the individual. Officers should avoid comingling individuals wearing spit hoods with other detainees.</p>
    <p>Spit hoods should not be used in situations where the restrained person is bleeding profusely from the area around the mouth or nose, or if there are indications that the person has a medical condition, such as difficulty breathing or vomiting. In such cases, prompt medical care should be obtained. If the person vomits while wearing a spit hood, the spit hood should be promptly removed and discarded. Persons who have been sprayed with oleoresin capsicum (OC) spray should be thoroughly decontaminated including hair, head and clothing prior to application of a spit hood.</p>
    <p>Those who have been placed in a spit hood should be continually monitored and shall not be left unattended until the spit hood is removed. Spit hoods shall be discarded after each use.</p>

    <h3>306.6 AUXILIARY RESTRAINT DEVICES</h3>
    <p>Auxiliary restraint devices include transport belts, waist or belly chains, transportation chains, leg irons and other similar devices. Auxiliary restraint devices are intended for use during long-term restraint or transportation. They provide additional security and safety without impeding breathing, while permitting adequate movement, comfort and mobility.</p>
    <p>Only department-authorized devices may be used. Any person in auxiliary restraints should be monitored as reasonably appears necessary.</p>

    <h3>306.7 LEG RESTRAINT DEVICES</h3>
    <p>Leg restraints may be used to restrain the legs of a violent or potentially violent person when it is reasonable to do so during the course of detention, arrest or transportation. Only restraint devices approved by the department shall be used. The RIPP Hobble is authorized for use by members of this Department.</p>
    <p>In determining whether to use the leg restraint, officers should consider:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Whether the officer or others could be exposed to injury due to the assaultive or resistant behavior of a suspect.</li>
        <li>Whether it is reasonably necessary to protect the suspect from his/her own actions (e.g., hitting his/her head against the interior of the patrol unit, running away from the arresting officer while handcuffed, kicking at objects or officers).</li>
        <li>Whether it is reasonably necessary to avoid damage to property (e.g., kicking at windows of the patrol unit).</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>306.7.1 GUIDELINES FOR USE OF LEG RESTRAINTS</h3>
    <p>When applying leg restraints the following guidelines should be followed:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>If practicable, officers should notify a supervisor of the intent to apply the leg restraint device. In all cases, a supervisor shall be notified as soon as practicable after the application of the leg restraint device.</li>
        <li>Once applied, absent a medical or other emergency, restraints should remain in place until the officer arrives at the jail or other facility or the person no longer reasonably appears to pose a threat.</li>
        <li>Once secured, the person should be placed in a seated or upright position, secured with a seat belt, and shall not be placed on his/her stomach for an extended period, as this could reduce the person's ability to breathe.</li>
        <li>The restrained person should be continually monitored by an officer while in the leg restraint. The officer should ensure that the person does not roll onto and remain on his/her stomach.</li>
        <li>The officer should look for signs of labored breathing and take appropriate steps to relieve and minimize any obvious factors contributing to this condition.</li>
        <li>When transported by ambulance/paramedic unit, the restrained person should be accompanied by an officer when requested by medical personnel. The transporting officer should describe to medical personnel any unusual behaviors or other circumstances the officer reasonably believes would be potential safety or medical risks to the subject (e.g., prolonged struggle, extreme agitation, impaired respiration).</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>306.8 REQUIRED DOCUMENTATION</h3>
    <p>If an individual is restrained and released without an arrest, the officer shall document the details of the detention and the need for handcuffs or other restraints.</p>
    <p>If an individual is arrested, the use of restraints other than handcuffs shall be documented in the related report. The officer should include, as appropriate:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>The amount of time the suspect was restrained.</li>
        <li>How the suspect was transported and the position of the suspect.</li>
        <li>Observations of the suspect's behavior and any signs of physiological problems.</li>
        <li>Any known or suspected drug use or other medical problems.</li>
    </ol>

            <div class="chapter" id="308">
    <h2>308 - Control Devices</h2>
    <h3>308.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>This policy provides guidelines for the use and maintenance of control devices that are described in this policy.</p>

    <h3>308.2 POLICY</h3>
    <p>In order to control subjects who are violent or who demonstrate the intent to be violent, the Metro Transit Police Department authorizes officers to use control devices in accordance with the guidelines in this policy and the Use of Force Policy.</p>

    <h3>308.3 ISSUING, CARRYING AND USING CONTROL DEVICES</h3>
    <p>Control devices described in this policy may be carried and used by members of this department only if the device has been issued by the Department or approved by the Chief of Police or the authorized designee.</p>
    <p>Only officers who have successfully completed department-approved training in the use of any control device are authorized to carry and use the device.</p>
    <p>Control devices may be used when a decision has been made to control, restrain or arrest a subject who is violent or who demonstrates the intent to be violent, and the use of the device appears reasonable under the circumstances. When reasonable, a verbal warning and opportunity to comply should precede the use of these devices.</p>
    <p>When using control devices, officers should carefully consider potential impact areas in order to minimize injuries and unintentional targets.</p>

    <h3>308.4 RESPONSIBILITIES</h3>
    <h4>308.4.1 SHIFT SUPERVISOR RESPONSIBILITIES</h4>
    <p>The Shift Supervisor may authorize the use of a control device by selected personnel or members of specialized units who have successfully completed the required training.</p>
    <h4>308.4.2 ARMORER RESPONSIBILITIES</h4>
    <p>The Training Coordinator shall control the inventory and issuance of all Department-issued control devices and shall ensure that all damaged, inoperative, outdated or expended control devices or munitions are properly disposed of, repaired or replaced.</p>
    <p>Every control device will be periodically inspected by the Training Coordinator or the designated instructor for a particular control device. The inspection shall be documented.</p>
    <h4>308.4.3 USER RESPONSIBILITIES</h4>
    <p>All normal maintenance, charging or cleaning shall remain the responsibility of personnel using the various devices.</p>
    <p>Any damaged, inoperative, outdated or expended control devices or munitions, along with documentation explaining the cause of the damage, shall be returned to the Training Coordinator for disposition. Damage to Department-issued property shall be documented and forwarded through the chain of command, when appropriate, explaining the cause of damage.</p>

    <h3>308.5 BATON GUIDELINES</h3>
    <p>The need to immediately control a suspect must be weighed against the risk of causing serious injury. The head, neck, throat, spine, heart, kidneys and groin should not be intentionally targeted except when the officer reasonably believes the suspect poses an imminent threat of serious bodily injury or death to the officer or others. Strikes to the above listed areas are considered deadly force.</p>
    <p>When carrying a baton, uniformed personnel shall carry the baton in its authorized holder on the equipment belt. Plainclothes and non-field personnel may carry the baton as authorized and in accordance with the needs of their assignment or at the direction of their supervisor.</p>

    <h3>308.6 TEAR GAS GUIDELINES</h3>
    <p>Tear gas may be used for crowd control, crowd dispersal or against barricaded suspects based on the circumstances. Only the Shift Supervisor, Incident Commander or Crisis Response Unit Commander may authorize the delivery and use of tear gas, and only after evaluating all conditions known at the time and determining that such force reasonably appears justified and necessary.</p>
    <p>When practicable, fire personnel should be alerted or summoned to the scene prior to the deployment of tear gas to control any fires and to assist in providing medical aid or gas evacuation if needed.</p>

    <h3>308.7 OLEORESIN CAPSICUM (OC) GUIDELINES</h3>
    <p>As with other control devices, oleoresin capsicum (OC) spray and pepper projectiles may be considered for use to bring under control an individual or groups of individuals who are engaging in, or are about to engage in violent behavior. Pepper projectiles and OC spray should not be used against individuals or groups who merely fail to disperse or do not reasonably appear to present a risk to the safety of officers or the public (i.e. passively resisting individuals or groups).</p>
    <h4>308.7.1 OC SPRAY</h4>
    <p>Uniformed personnel carrying OC spray shall carry the device in its holster on the equipment belt. Plainclothes and non-field personnel may carry OC spray as authorized, in accordance with the needs of their assignment or at the direction of their supervisor.</p>
    <h4>308.7.2 PEPPER PROJECTILE SYSTEMS</h4>
    <p>Pepper projectiles are plastic spheres that are filled with a derivative of OC powder. Because the compressed gas launcher delivers the projectiles with enough force to burst the projectiles on impact and release the OC powder, the potential exists for the projectiles to inflict injury if they strike the head, neck, spine or groin. Therefore, personnel deploying a pepper projectile</p>
    <p>system should not intentionally target those areas, except when the officer reasonably believes the suspect poses an imminent threat of serious bodily injury or death to the officer or others.</p>
    <p>Officers encountering a situation that warrants the use of a pepper projectile system shall notify a supervisor as soon as practicable. A supervisor shall respond to all pepper projectile system incidents where the suspect has been hit or exposed to the chemical agent. The supervisor shall ensure that all notifications and reports are completed as required by the Use of Force Policy.</p>
    <p>Each deployment of a pepper projectile system shall be documented. This includes situations where the launcher was directed toward the suspect, whether or not the launcher was used. Unintentional discharges shall be promptly reported to a supervisor and documented on the appropriate report form. Only non-incident use of a pepper projectile system, such as training and product demonstrations, is exempt from the reporting requirement.</p>
    <h4>308.7.3 TREATMENT FOR OC SPRAY EXPOSURE</h4>
    <p>Persons who have been sprayed with or otherwise affected by the use of OC should be promptly provided with medical attention (e.g. fresh air, seated upright, cool water etc) to address the affected areas. Those persons who complain of further severe effects shall be examined by appropriate medical personnel.</p>

    <h3>308.8 POST-APPLICATION NOTICE</h3>
    <p>Whenever tear gas or OC has been introduced into a residence, building interior, vehicle or other enclosed area, officers should provide the owners or available occupants with notice of the possible presence of residue that could result in irritation or injury if the area is not properly cleaned. Such notice should include advisement that clean up will be at the owner’s expense. Information regarding the method of notice and the individuals notified should be included in related reports.</p>

    <h3>308.9 KINETIC ENERGY PROJECTILE GUIDELINES</h3>
    <p>This department is committed to reducing the potential for violent confrontations. Kinetic energy projectiles, when used properly, are less likely to result in death or serious physical injury and can be used in an attempt to de-escalate a potentially deadly situation.</p>
    <h4>308.9.1 DEPLOYMENT AND USE</h4>
    <p>Only department-approved kinetic energy munitions shall be carried and deployed. Approved munitions may be used to compel an individual to cease his/her actions when such munitions present a reasonable option.</p>
    <p>Officers are not required or compelled to use approved munitions in lieu of other reasonable tactics if the involved officer determines that deployment of these munitions cannot be done safely. The safety of hostages, innocent persons and officers takes priority over the safety of subjects engaged in criminal or suicidal behavior.</p>
    <p>Circumstances appropriate for deployment include, but are not limited to, situations in which:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>The suspect is armed with a weapon and the tactical circumstances allow for the safe application of approved munitions.</li>
        <li>The suspect has made credible threats to harm him/herself or others.</li>
        <li>The suspect is engaged in riotous behavior or is throwing rocks, bottles or other dangerous projectiles at people and/or officers.</li>
        <li>There is probable cause to believe that the suspect has already committed a crime of violence and is refusing to comply with lawful orders.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>308.9.2 DEPLOYMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h4>
    <p>Before discharging projectiles, the officer should consider such factors as:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Distance and angle to target.</li>
        <li>Type of munitions employed.</li>
        <li>Type and thickness of subject’s clothing.</li>
        <li>The subject’s proximity to others.</li>
        <li>The location of the subject.</li>
        <li>Whether the subject’s actions dictate the need for an immediate response and the use of control devices appears appropriate.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>A verbal warning of the intended use of the device should precede its application, unless it would otherwise endanger the safety of officers or when it is not practicable due to the circumstances. The purpose of the warning is to give the individual a reasonable opportunity to voluntarily comply and to warn other officers and individuals that the device is being deployed.</p>
    <p>Officers should keep in mind the manufacturer’s recommendations and their training regarding effective distances and target areas. However, officers are not restricted solely to use according to manufacturer recommendations. Each situation must be evaluated on the totality of circumstances at the time of deployment.</p>
    <p>The need to immediately incapacitate the subject must be weighed against the risk of causing serious injury or death. The head and neck should not be intentionally targeted, except when the officer reasonably believes the suspect poses an imminent threat of serious bodily injury or death to the officer or others.</p>
    <h4>308.9.3 SAFETY PROCEDURES</h4>
    <p>Shotguns specifically designated for use with kinetic energy projectiles will be specially marked in a manner that makes them readily identifiable as such.</p>
    <p>Officers will inspect the shotgun and projectiles at the beginning of each shift to ensure that the shotgun is in proper working order and the projectiles are of the approved type and appear to be free from defects.</p>
    <p>When it is not deployed, the shotgun will be unloaded and properly and securely stored in the vehicle. When deploying the kinetic energy projectile shotgun, the officer shall visually inspect the kinetic energy projectiles to ensure that conventional ammunition is not being loaded into the shotgun.</p>
    <p>Absent compelling circumstances, officers who must transition from conventional ammunition to kinetic energy projectiles will employ the two-person rule for loading. The two-person rule is a safety measure in which a second officer watches the unloading and loading process to ensure that the weapon is completely emptied of conventional ammunition.</p>

    <h3>308.10 TRAINING FOR CONTROL DEVICES</h3>
    <p>The Training Coordinator shall ensure that all personnel who are authorized to carry a control device have been properly trained and certified to carry the specific control device and are re- trained or re-certified as necessary.</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Proficiency training shall be monitored and documented by a certified, control-device weapons or tactics instructor.</li>
        <li>All training and proficiency for control devices will be documented in the officer's training file.</li>
        <li>Officers who fail to demonstrate proficiency with the control device or knowledge of this agency's Use of Force Policy will be provided remedial training. If an officer cannot demonstrate proficiency with a control device or knowledge of this agency's Use of Force Policy after remedial training, the officer will be restricted from carrying the control device and may be subject to discipline.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>308.11 REPORTING USE OF CONTROL DEVICES AND TECHNIQUES</h3>
    <p>Any application of a control device or technique listed in this policy shall be documented in the related incident report and reported pursuant to the Use of Force Policy.</p>
</div>

            <div class="chapter" id="309">
    <h2>309 - Conducted Energy Device</h2>
    <h3>309.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>This policy provides guidelines for the issuance and use of the Conducted Energy Device (CED).</p>

    <h3>309.2 POLICY</h3>
    <p>The TASER device is intended to control a violent or potentially violent individual, while minimizing the risk of serious injury. The appropriate use of such a device should result in fewer serious injuries to officers and suspects.</p>

    <h3>309.3 ISSUANCE AND CARRYING TASER DEVICES</h3>
    <p>Only members who have successfully completed department-approved training may be issued and carry the TASER device.</p>
    <p>TASER devices are issued for use during a member's current assignment. Those leaving a particular assignment may be required to return the device to the department's inventory.</p>
    <p>Officers shall only use the TASER device and cartridges that have been issued by the Department. Uniformed officers who have been issued the TASER device shall wear the device in an approved holster on their person. Non-uniformed officers may secure the TASER device in the driver's compartment of their vehicle.</p>
    <p>Members carrying the TASER device should perform a spark test on the unit prior to every shift.</p>
    <p>When carried while in uniform, officers shall carry the TASER device in a weak-side holster on the side opposite the duty weapon.</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>All TASER devices shall be clearly and distinctly marked to differentiate them from the duty weapon and any other device.</li>
        <li>Whenever practicable, officers should carry two or more cartridges on their person when carrying the TASER device.</li>
        <li>Officers shall be responsible for ensuring that their issued TASER device is properly maintained and in good working order.</li>
        <li>Officers should not hold both a firearm and the TASER device at the same time.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>309.4 VERBAL AND VISUAL WARNINGS</h3>
    <p>A verbal warning of the intended use of the TASER device should precede its application, unless it would otherwise endanger the safety of officers or when it is not practicable due to the circumstances. The purpose of the warning is to:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Provide the individual with a reasonable opportunity to voluntarily comply.</li>
        <li>Provide other officers and individuals with a warning that the TASER device may be deployed.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If, after a verbal warning, an individual is unwilling to voluntarily comply with an officer's lawful orders and it appears both reasonable and feasible under the circumstances, the officer may, but is not required to, display the electrical arc (provided that a cartridge has not been loaded into the device), or the laser in a further attempt to gain compliance prior to the application of the TASER device. The aiming laser should never be intentionally directed into the eyes of another as it may permanently impair his/her vision.</p>
    <p>The fact that a verbal or other warning was given or the reasons it was not given shall be documented by the officer deploying the TASER device in the related report.</p>

    <h3>309.5 DOCUMENTATION</h3>
    <p>Officers shall document all TASER device discharges in the related arrest/crime report and the TASER device report form. Notification shall also be made to a supervisor in compliance with the Use of Force Policy. Unintentional discharges, pointing the device at a person, laser activation and arcing the device will also be documented on the report form.</p>
    <h4>309.5.1 TASER DEVICE FORM</h4>
    <p>Items that shall be included in the TASER device report form are:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>The type and brand of TASER device and cartridge and cartridge serial number.</li>
        <li>Date, time and location of the incident.</li>
        <li>Whether any display, laser or arc deterred a subject and gained compliance.</li>
        <li>The number of TASER device activations, the duration of each cycle, the duration between activations, and (as best as can be determined) the duration that the subject received applications.</li>
        <li>The range at which the TASER device was used.</li>

    </ol>

    <h3>309.6 MEDICAL TREATMENT</h3>
    <p>Metro Transit Police Department officers may carefully remove TASER device darts from a person's body following routine application of the TASER device. Used TASER device probes shall be treated as a sharps biohazard, similar to a used hypodermic needle, and handled appropriately. Universal precautions should be taken.</p>
    <p>All persons who have been struck by TASER device probes or who have been subjected to the electric discharge of the device shall be medically assessed prior to booking. Additionally, any such individual who falls under any of the following categories should, as soon as practicable, be examined by paramedics or other qualified medical personnel:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>The person is suspected of being under the influence of controlled substances and/or alcohol.</li>
        <li>The person may be pregnant.</li>
        <li>The person reasonably appears to be in need of medical attention.</li>

        <li>The person requests medical treatment.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Any individual exhibiting signs of distress or who is exposed to multiple or prolonged applications (i.e., more than 15 seconds) shall be transported to a medical facility for examination or medically evaluated prior to booking. If any individual refuses medical attention, such a refusal should be witnessed by another officer and/or medical personnel and shall be fully documented in related</p>
    <p>reports. If an audio recording is made of the contact or an interview with the individual, any refusal should be included, if possible.</p>
    <p>The transporting officer shall inform any person providing medical care or receiving custody that the individual has been subjected to the application of the TASER device.</p>

    <h3>309.7 SUPERVISOR RESPONSIBILITIES</h3>
    <p>A supervisor should review each incident where a person has been exposed to an activation of the TASER device. The supervisor shall complete a supplement under the related case report.</p>

    <h3>309.8 TRAINING</h3>
    <p>Personnel who are authorized to carry the TASER device shall be permitted to do so only after successfully completing the initial department-approved training.

    <p>Proficiency training for personnel who have been issued TASER devices should occur every year. A reassessment of an officer's knowledge and/or practical skill may be required at any time if deemed appropriate by the Training Coordinator. All training and proficiency for TASER devices will be documented in the officer's training file.</p>
    <p>Command staff, supervisors and investigators should receive TASER device training as appropriate for the investigations they conduct and review.</p>
    <p>Officers who do not carry TASER devices should receive training that is sufficient to familiarize them with the device and with working with officers who use the device.</p>
    <p>The Training Coordinator is responsible for ensuring that all members who carry TASER devices have received initial and annual proficiency training. Periodic audits should be used for verification.</p>
    <p>Application of TASER devices during training could result in injury to personnel and should not be mandatory for certification.</p>
    <p>The Training Coordinator should ensure that all training includes:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>A review of this policy.</li>
        <li>A review of the Use of Force Policy.</li>
        <li>Performing weak-hand draws or cross-draws to reduce the possibility of accidentally drawing and firing a firearm.</li>

    <h2>310 - Officer-Involved Shootings and Deaths</h2>
    <h3>310.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this policy is to establish policy and procedures for the investigation of an incident in which a person is injured or dies as the result of an officer-involved shooting or dies as a result of other action of an officer.</p>
    <p>In other incidents not covered by this policy, the Chief of Police may decide that the investigation will follow the process provided in this policy.</p>
    <h4>310.1.1 DEFINITIONS</h4>
    <p><strong>Critical Incident</strong> - An incident involving any of the following situations occurring in the line of duty:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>The use of Deadly Force by or against a Metro Transit Police Officer.</li>
        <li>Death or Great Bodily Harm to a Metro Transit Police Officer.</li>
        <li>Death or Great Bodily Harm to a person who is in the custody or control of a Metro Transit Police Officer.</li>
        <li>Any action by a Metro Transit Police Officer that causes or is intended to cause Death or Great Bodily Harm.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Deadly Force</strong> - Force which the actor uses with the purpose of causing, or which the actor should reasonably know creates a substantial risk of causing, death or great bodily harm. The intentional discharge of a firearm, other than a firearm loaded with less lethal munitions and used by a peace officer within the scope of official duties, in the direction of another person, or at a vehicle in which another person is believed to be, constitutes deadly force. "Less lethal munitions" means projectiles which are designed to stun, temporarily incapacitate, or cause temporary discomfort to a person. (Minn. Stat. § 609.066 Subd. 1).</p>
    <p><strong>Great Bodily Harm</strong> - Bodily injury which creates a high probability of death, or which causes serious permanent disfigurement, or which causes a permanent or protracted loss or impairment of the function of any bodily member or organ or other serious bodily harm. (Minn. Stat. § 609.02 Subd. 8).</p>

    <h3>310.2 TYPES OF INVESTIGATIONS</h2>
    <p>Officer-involved shootings and deaths involve several separate investigations. The investigations may include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>A criminal investigation of the suspect’s actions.</li>
        <li>A criminal investigation of the involved officer’s actions.</li>
        <li>An administrative investigation as to policy compliance by involved officers.</li>
        <li>A civil investigation to determine potential liability.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>310.3 CONTROL OF INVESTIGATIONS</h3>
    <p>Investigators from surrounding agencies may be assigned to work on the criminal investigation of officer-involved shootings and deaths. This may include at least one investigator from the agency that employs the involved officer.</p>
    <p>Jurisdiction is determined by the location of the shooting or death and the agency employing the involved officer. The following scenarios outline the jurisdictional responsibilities for investigating officer-involved shootings and deaths.</p>
    <h4>310.3.1 CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION OF SUSPECT ACTIONS</h4>
    <p>The investigation of any possible criminal conduct by the suspect is controlled by the agency in whose jurisdiction the suspect’s crime occurred. For example, the Minneapolis Police Department would control the investigation if the suspect’s crime occurred in the City of Minneapolis .</p>
    <p>If multiple crimes have been committed in multiple jurisdictions, identification of the agency that will control the investigation may be reached in the same way as with any other crime. The investigation may be conducted by the agency in control of the criminal investigation of the involved officer, at the discretion of the Chief of Police and with concurrence from the other agency.</p>
    <h4>310.3.2 POST ADMINISTRATIVE INVESTIGATIONS</h4>
    <p>The Minnesota POST Board may require an administrative investigation based on a complaint alleging a violation of a statute or rule that the board is empowered to enforce. An officer-involved shooting may result in such an allegation. Any such complaint assigned to this department shall be completed and a written summary submitted to the POST executive director within 30 days of the order for inquiry (Minn. Stat. § 214.10 Subd. 10).</p>

    <h3>310.4 INVESTIGATION PROCESS</h3>
    <p>The following procedures are guidelines used in the investigation of an officer-involved shooting or death:</p>
    <h4>310.4.1 UNINVOLVED OFFICER RESPONSIBILITIES</h4>
    <p>Upon arrival at the scene of an officer-involved shooting or death, the first uninvolved MTPD officer will be the officer-in-charge and will assume the responsibilities of a supervisor until properly relieved. This officer should, as appropriate:</p>

    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Attempt to obtain a brief overview of the situation from any uninvolved officers.</p>
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>In the event that there are no uninvolved officers who can supply adequate overview, the supervisor should attempt to obtain a brief voluntary overview from one involved officer.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>If necessary, the supervisor may administratively order any MTPD officer to immediately provide public safety information necessary to secure the scene, identify injured parties and pursue suspects.
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>Public safety information shall be limited to such things as outstanding suspect information, number and direction of any shots fired, perimeter of the incident scene, identity of known or potential witnesses and any other pertinent information.</li>
                <li>The initial on-scene supervisor should not attempt to order any involved officer to provide any information other than public safety information.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Provide all available information to the Shift Supervisor and Transit Control Center. If feasible, sensitive information should be communicated over secure networks.</li>
        <li>Take command of and secure the incident scene with additional MTPD members until properly relieved by another supervisor or other assigned personnel or investigator.</li>
        <li>As soon as practicable, ensure that involved officers are transported (separately, if feasible) to a suitable location for further direction.
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>Each involved MTPD officer should be given an administrative order not to discuss the incident with other involved officers or MTPD members pending further direction from a supervisor.</li>
                <li>When an involved officer’s weapon is taken or left at the scene for other than officer- safety reasons (e.g., evidence), ensure that he/she is provided with a comparable replacement weapon or transported by other officers.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>310.4.3 SHIFT SUPERVISOR RESPONSIBILITIES</h4>
    <p>Upon learning of an officer-involved shooting or death, the Shift Supervisor shall be responsible for coordinating all aspects of the incident until he/she is relieved by the Chief of Police, Deputy Chief of Police or a Captain.</p>

    <h4>310.4.5 INVOLVED OFFICERS</h4>
    <p>The following shall be considered for the involved officer:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Any request for legal or union representation will be accommodated.</p>
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>Involved MTPD officers shall not be permitted to meet collectively or in a group with an attorney or any representative prior to providing a formal interview or report.</li>
                <li>Requests from involved non-MTPD officers should be referred to their employing agency.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Discussions with licensed attorneys will be considered privileged as attorney-client communications.</li>

            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>Interviews with a licensed psychotherapist will be considered privileged.</li>
                <li>An interview or session with a licensed psychotherapist may take place prior to the member providing a formal interview or report. However, involved members shall not be permitted to consult or meet collectively or in a group with a licensed psychotherapist prior to providing a formal interview or report.</li>
                <li>A separate fitness-for-duty exam may also be required (see the Fitness for Duty Policy).</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Communications with peer counselors are privileged and shall not be disclosed without the permission of the involved officer. The peer counselor, however, may disclose information that he/she reasonably believes indicates that the officer may be a danger to self or others, as long as the information is used only for the purpose of eliminating the danger. Such</li>
    </ol>
    <p>information or opinion is not admissible in any personnel or occupational licensing matter involving the officer (Minn. Stat. § 181.973).</p>
    <p>Care should be taken to preserve the integrity of any physical evidence present on the involved officer's equipment or clothing, such as blood or fingerprints, until investigators or lab personnel can properly retrieve it.</p>
    <p>Each involved MTPD officer shall be given reasonable paid administrative leave following an officer-involved shooting or death. In most cases, a minimum of three days and a maximum of seven days shall be considered as reasonable. The Chief of Police must approve paid administrative leave time extending beyond the seven day maximum. It shall be the responsibility of the Shift Supervisor to make schedule adjustments to accommodate such leave.</p>
    <h4>310.4.6 MONITORING OFFICERS The monitoring officer(s) shall:</h4>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Assume control of the involved officer as directed by the on-scene supervisor.</li>
        <li>Bring the involved officer to a department vehicle and accompany the involved officer to the police department or the location determined by the supervisor.</li>
        <li>The monitoring officer shall check in with the Investigations Supervisor or his/her designee once at the determined location.</li>
        <li>Remain with the involved officer at the determined location until advised by the Investigations Supervisor that you are relieved of that duty.</li>
        <li>The monitoring officer will allow a union representative or designee access to the involved officer(s) until a formal statement is given or legal counsel is present. This access shall be continually monitored to ensure that details of the investigation are not discussed with anyone other than legal counsel and/or the involved officer's union representative.</li>
        <li>The monitoring officer will write a report detailing his/her actions, including who had access to the involved officer, length of time of the contact and specifically document whether the involved officer spoke with anyone about the incident while in his/her company.</li>
        <li>Upon request of the involved officer(s), ensure that the involved officer(s) is afforded the opportunity to meet with legal counsel in a confidential setting.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>310.5  CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION</h4>
    <p>This Department will utilize the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) to conduct an independent criminal investigation into the circumstances of any officer-involved shooting or death.</p>
    <p>If available, investigative personnel from this departmentoffice may be assigned to partner with investigators from outside agencies or the DistrictCountyAttorney's Office to avoid duplicating efforts in related criminal investigations.</p>
    <p>Once public safety issues have been addressed, criminal investigators should be given the opportunity to obtain a voluntary statement from involved officers and to complete their interviews. The following shall be considered for the involved officer:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>agencyAcronym supervisors and InternalAffairsUnit / Internal Affairs Unit personnel should not participate directly in any voluntary interview of agencyAcronym officers. This will not prohibit such personnel from monitoring interviews or providing the criminal investigators with topics for inquiry.</li>
        <li>If requested, any involved officer will be afforded the opportunity to consult individually with a representative of his/her choosing or an attorney prior to speaking with criminal investigators. However, in order to maintain the integrity of each involved officer’s statement, involved officers shall not consult or meet with a representative or an attorney collectively or in groups prior to being interviewed.</li>
        <li>If any involved officer is physically, emotionally or otherwise not in a position to provide a voluntary statement when interviewed by criminal investigators, consideration should be given to allowing a reasonable period for the officer to schedule an alternate time for the interview.</li>
        <li>Any voluntary statement provided by an involved officer will be made available for inclusion in any related investigation, including administrative investigations. However, no administratively coerced statement will be provided to any criminal investigators unless the officer consents.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>310.5.1 REPORTS BY INVOLVED MTPD OFFICERS</h4>
    <p>In the event that suspects remain outstanding or subject to prosecution for related offenses, this department shall retain the authority to require involved MTPD officers to provide sufficient information for related criminal reports to facilitate the apprehension and prosecution of those individuals.</p>
    <p>While the involved MTPD officer may write the report, it is generally recommended that such reports be completed by assigned investigators, who should interview all involved officers as victims/witnesses. Since the purpose of these reports will be to facilitate criminal prosecution, statements of involved officers should focus on evidence to establish the elements of criminal activities by suspects. Care should be taken not to duplicate information provided by involved officers in other reports.</p>
    <p>Nothing in this section shall be construed to deprive an involved MTPD officer of the right to consult with legal counsel prior to completing any such criminal report.</p>
    <p>Reports related to the prosecution of criminal suspects will be processed according to normal procedures but should also be included for reference in the investigation of the officer-involved shooting or death.</p>
    <h4>310.5.2 WITNESS IDENTIFICATION AND INTERVIEWS</h4>
    <p>Because potential witnesses to an officer-involved shooting or death may become unavailable or the integrity of their statements compromised with the passage of time, a supervisor should</p>
    <p>take reasonable steps to promptly coordinate with criminal investigators to utilize available law enforcement personnel for the following:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Identification of all persons present at the scene and in the immediate area.
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>When feasible, a recorded statement should be obtained from those persons who claim not to have witnessed the incident but who were present at the time it occurred.
                </li>
                <li>Any potential witness who is unwilling or unable to remain available for a formal interview should not be detained absent reasonable suspicion to detain or probable cause to arrest. Without detaining the individual for the sole purpose of identification, attempts to identify the witness prior to his/her departure should be made whenever feasible.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Witnesses who are willing to provide a formal interview should be asked to meet at a suitable location where criminal investigators may obtain a recorded statement. Such witnesses, if willing, may be transported by a member of the Department.
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>A written, verbal or recorded statement of consent should be obtained prior to transporting a witness. When the witness is a minor, consent should be obtained from the parent or guardian, if available, prior to transportation.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Promptly contacting the suspect’s known family and associates to obtain any available and untainted background information about the suspect’s activities and state of mind prior to the incident.</p>
    <h4>310.5.3 INVESTIGATIVE PERSONNEL</h4>
    <p>Once notified of an officer-involved shooting or death, it shall be the responsibility of the designated Investigation Division supervisor to assign appropriate investigative personnel to handle the investigation of related crimes. Department investigators will be assigned to work with investigators from the outside agency and may be assigned to separately handle the investigation of any related crimes not being investigated by the outside agency.</p>
    <p>All related department reports, except administrative and/or privileged reports, will be forwarded to the designated Investigation Division supervisor for approval. Privileged reports shall be maintained exclusively by members who are authorized such access. Administrative reports will be forwarded to the appropriate Supervisor .</p>

    <h3>310.6 ADMINISTRATIVE INVESTIGATION</h3>
    <p>In addition to all other investigations associated with an officer-involved shooting or death, this department will conduct an internal administrative investigation of involved MTPD officers to determine conformance with department policy. This investigation will be conducted under the supervision of the Professional Standards Unit / Internal Affairs Unit and will be considered a confidential officer personnel file.</p>
    <p>Interviews of members shall be subject to department policies and applicable laws (Personnel Complaints Policy; Minn. Stat. § 626.89).</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Any officer involved in a shooting or death may be requested or administratively compelled to provide a blood sample for alcohol/drug screening in accordance with the drug and alcohol testing guidelines in the Drug and Alcohol-Free Workplace Policy adopted under the authority of Minn. Stat. § 181.950 to Minn. Stat. § 181.957. Absent consent from the officer, such compelled samples and the results of any such testing shall not be disclosed to any criminal investigative agency.</li>
        <li>If any officer has voluntarily elected to provide a statement to criminal investigators, the assigned administrative investigator should review that statement before proceeding with any further interview of that involved officer.
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>If a further interview of the officer is deemed necessary to determine policy compliance, care should be taken to limit the inquiry to new areas with minimal, if any, duplication of questions addressed in the voluntary statement. The involved officer shall be provided with a copy of his/her prior statement before proceeding with any subsequent interviews.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>In the event that an involved officer has elected not to provide criminal investigators with a voluntary statement, the assigned administrative investigator shall conduct an administrative interview to determine all relevant information .
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>Although this interview should not be unreasonably delayed, care should be taken to ensure that the officer’s physical and psychological needs have been addressed before commencing the interview.</li>
                <li>The interview must be taken at the MTPD or at a place agreed to by the interviewer and the involved officer.</li>
                <li>The interview must be of reasonable duration and provide the involved officer reasonable periods for rest and personal necessities. When practicable, the interview must be held during the involved officer’s regularly scheduled work shift. If not, the involved officer must be compensated at his/her current pay rate.</li>
                <li>If requested, the officer shall have the opportunity to select an uninvolved representative or an attorney, or both, to be present during the interview. However, in order to maintain the integrity of each individual officer’s statement, involved officers shall not consult or meet with a representative collectively or in groups prior to being interviewed.</li>
                <li>Administrative interviews shall be recorded electronically or otherwise by the investigator. The officer may also record the interview. A complete copy or transcript of the interview must be provided to the involved officer upon written request without charge or undue delay.</li>
                <li>The officer shall be informed of the nature of the investigation. If an officer refuses to answer questions, he/she should be given his/her Garrity rights and ordered to provide full and truthful answers to all questions. The officer shall be informed in writing or on the record that the interview will be for administrative purposes only and that the statement cannot be used criminally.</li>
                <li>The Professional Standards Unit / Internal Affairs Unit shall compile all relevant information and reports necessary for the Department to determine compliance with applicable policies.</li>
                <li>Regardless of whether the use of force is an issue in the case, the completed administrative investigation shall be submitted to the Use of Force Review Board, which will restrict its findings as to whether there was compliance with the Use of Force Policy.</li>
                <li>Any other indications of potential policy violations shall be determined in accordance with standard disciplinary procedures.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>310.7 CIVIL LIABILITY RESPONSE</h3>
    <p>A member of this department may be assigned to work exclusively under the direction of the legal counsel for the Department to assist in the preparation of materials deemed necessary in anticipation of potential civil litigation.</p>
    <p>All materials generated in this capacity shall be considered attorney work product and may not be used for any other purpose. The civil liability response is not intended to interfere with any other investigation but shall be given reasonable access to all other investigations.</p>

    <h3>310.8 AUDIO AND VIDEO RECORDINGS</h3>
    <p>Any officer involved in a shooting or death may be permitted to review available Mobile Audio/ Video (MAV), body-worn video, or other video or audio recordings prior to providing a recorded statement or completing reports.</p>
    <p>Upon request, non-law enforcement witnesses who are able to verify their presence and their ability to contemporaneously perceive events at the scene of an incident may also be permitted to review available MAV, body-worn video, or other video or audio recordings with the approval of assigned investigators or a supervisor.</p>
    <p>Any MAV, body-worn and other known video or audio recordings of an incident should not be publicly released during an ongoing investigation without consulting the prosecuting attorney or Prosecuting Attorney’s Office, as appropriate.</p>

    <h3>310.9 DEBRIEFING</h3>
    <p>Following an officer-involved shooting or death, the Metro Transit Police Department should conduct both a critical incident/stress debriefing and a tactical debriefing.</p>
    <h4>310.9.1 CRITICAL INCIDENT/STRESS DEBRIEFING</h4>
    <p>A critical incident/stress debriefing should occur as soon as practicable. The Patrol Captain is responsible for organizing the debriefing. Notes and recorded statements should not be taken because the sole purpose of the debriefing is to help mitigate the stress-related effects of a traumatic event (Minn. Stat. § 181.973).</p>
    <p>The debriefing is not part of any investigative process. Care should be taken not to release or repeat any communication made during a debriefing unless otherwise authorized by policy, law or a valid court order.</p>
    <p>Attendance at the debriefing shall only include those members of the Department directly involved in the incident, which can include support personnel (e.g., dispatchers, other non-sworn). Family or other support personnel may attend with the concurrence of those involved in the incident. The debriefing shall be closed to the public and should be closed to all other members of the Department, including supervisory and Professional Standards Unit / Internal Affairs Unit personnel.</p>
    <h4>310.9.2 TACTICAL DEBRIEFING</h4>
    <p>A tactical debriefing should take place to identify any training or areas of policy that need improvement. The Chief of Police should identify the appropriate participants. This debriefing should not be conducted until all involved members have provided recorded or formal statements to criminal and/or administrative investigators.</p>

    <h3>310.10 MEDIA RELATIONS</h3>
    <p>Any media release shall be prepared with input and concurrence from the supervisor and department representative responsible for each phase of the investigation. Releases will be available to the Chief of Police or designee and Public Information Officer in the event of inquiries from the media.</p>
    <p>No involved MTPD officer shall make any comment to the media unless he/she is authorized by the Chief of Police or designee.</p>
    <p>Department members receiving inquiries regarding officer-involved shootings or deaths occurring in other jurisdictions shall refrain from public comment and will direct those inquiries to the agency having jurisdiction and primary responsibility for the investigation.</p>

    <h3>310.11 REPORTING</h3>
    <p>If an officer discharges a firearm in the course of duty, the Chief of Police shall notify the Commissioner of Public Safety within 30 days of the reason for and the circumstances surrounding the discharge of the firearm (Minn. Stat.§ 626.553).</p>

This exclusion does not apply to the carrying of a single folding pocketknife that is not otherwise prohibited by law.</p>
    <h4>312.3.1 HANDGUNS</h4>
    <p>The authorized department-issued handgun is the Glock 17.</p>
    <p>The following additional handguns are approved for on-duty use by part-time sworn officers:</p>

    <p>The carrying of firearms by members while off-duty is permitted by the Chief of Police but may be rescinded should circumstances dictate (e.g., administrative leave). Members who choose to carry a firearm while off-duty, based on their authority as peace officers, will be required to meet the following guidelines:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>A personally owned firearm shall be used, carried and inspected in accordance with the Personally Owned Firearms requirements in this policy.
            <ol>
                <li>The purchase of the personally owned firearm and ammunition shall be the responsibility of the member.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>The firearm shall be carried concealed at all times and in such a manner as to prevent unintentional cocking, discharge or loss of physical control.</li>

        <li>Prior to carrying any off-duty firearm, the member shall demonstrate to the Armorer that he/ she is proficient in handling and firing the firearm and that it will be carried in a safe manner.</li>
        <li>The member will successfully qualify with the firearm prior to it being carried.</li>
        <li>Members shall provide written notice of the make, model, color, serial number and caliber of the firearm to the Armorer, who will maintain a list of the information.</li>
        <li>If a member desires to use more than one firearm while off-duty, he/she may do so, as long as all requirements set forth in this policy for each firearm are met.</li>
        <li>Members shall only carry department-authorized ammunition</li>
        <li>When armed, officers shall carry their badges and Metro Transit Police Department identification cards under circumstances requiring possession of such identification.</li>
    </ol>

Replacements for unserviceable or depleted ammunition issued by the Department shall be dispensed by the Armorer when needed, in accordance with established policy.</p>
    <p>Members carrying personally owned authorized firearms of a caliber differing from department- issued firearms shall be responsible for obtaining fresh duty ammunition in accordance with the above, at their own expense. Replacements for unserviceable or depleted ammunition issued by the Department shall be dispensed by the Armorer when needed, in accordance with established policy.</p>

    <h3>312.4 EQUIPMENT</h3>
    <p>Firearms carried on- or off-duty shall be maintained in a clean, serviceable condition. Maintenance and repair of authorized personally owned firearms are the responsibility of the individual member.</p>
    <h4>312.4.1 REPAIRS OR MODIFICATIONS</h4>
    <p>Each member shall be responsible for promptly reporting any damage or malfunction of an assigned firearm to a supervisor or the Armorer.</p>
    <p>Firearms that are the property of the Department or personally owned firearms that are approved for department use may be repaired or modified only by a person who is department-approved</p>
    <p>and certified as an armorer or gunsmith in the repair of the specific firearm. Such modification or repair must be authorized in advance by the Armorer.</p>
    <p>Any repairs or modifications to the member’s personally owned firearm shall be done at his/her expense and must be approved by the Armorer.</p>

Once approved sights have been properly installed on any firearm, the member shall qualify with the firearm to ensure proper functionality and sighting of the firearm prior to carrying it.</p>
    <p>Except in an approved training situation, a member may only sight in on a target when the member would otherwise be justified in pointing a firearm at the target.</p>

    <h3>312.5 SAFE HANDLING, INSPECTION AND STORAGE</h3>
    <p>Members shall maintain the highest level of safety when handling firearms and shall consider the following:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Members shall not unnecessarily display or handle any firearm.</li>

If the firearm is the member’s primary duty firearm, a replacement firearm will be issued to the member until the duty firearm is serviceable.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>312.5.1 INSPECTION AND STORAGE</h4>
    <p>Handguns shall be inspected regularly and upon access or possession by another person. Rifles shall be inspected at the beginning of the shift by the member to whom the weapon is issued. The member shall ensure that the firearm is carried in the proper condition and loaded with approved ammunition. Inspection of the rifle shall be done while standing outside of the patrol vehicle. All firearms shall be pointed in a safe direction or into clearing barrels.</p>
    <p>Personally owned firearms may be safely stored in lockers at the end of the shift. Department- owned firearms shall be stored appropriately. Handguns may remain loaded if they are secured in an appropriate holster. Rifles shall be unloaded in a safe manner and then stored appropriately.</p>
    <h4>312.5.2 STORAGE AT HOME</h4>
    <p>Members shall ensure that all firearms and ammunition are locked and secured while in their homes, vehicles or any other area under their control, and in a manner that will keep them inaccessible to children and others who should not have access. Members shall not permit department-issued firearms to be handled by anyone not authorized by the Department to do so. Members should be aware that negligent storage of a firearm could result in civil and criminal liability (Minn. Stat. § 609.666; Minn. Stat. § 609.378).</p>
    <h4>312.5.3 ALCOHOL AND DRUGS</h4>
    <p>Firearms shall not be carried by any member, either on- or off-duty, who has consumed an amount of an alcoholic beverage, taken any drugs or medication, or has taken any combination thereof that would tend to adversely affect the member’s senses or judgment.</p>

    <h3>312.6 FIREARMS TRAINING AND QUALIFICATIONS</h3>
    <p>All members who carry a firearm while on-duty are required to successfully complete training with their duty firearms. In addition to regular training, all members will qualify at least annually with their duty firearms (Minn. Stat. § 626.8452). Members will qualify with off-duty and secondary firearms at least once a year. Training and qualifications must be on an approved range course.</p>
    <p>At least annually, all members carrying a firearm should receive practical training designed to simulate field situations including low-light shooting.</p>
    <h4>312.6.1 NON-CERTIFICATION OR NON-QUALIFICATION</h4>
    <p>If any member fails to meet minimum standards for firearms training or qualification for any reason, including injury, illness, duty status or scheduling conflict, that member shall submit a memorandum to his/her immediate supervisor prior to the end of the required training or qualification period.</p>
    <p>Those who fail to meet minimum standards or qualify on their first shooting attempt shall be provided remedial training and will be subject to the following requirements:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Additional range assignments may be scheduled to assist the member in demonstrating consistent firearm proficiency.</li>
        <li>Members shall be given credit for a range training or qualification when obtaining a qualifying score or meeting standards after remedial training.</li>
        <li>No range credit will be given for the following:
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>Unauthorized range make-up</li>
                <li>Failure to meet minimum standards or qualify after remedial training</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Members who repeatedly fail to meet minimum standards will be removed from field assignment and may be subject to disciplinary action.</p>

    <h3>312.7 FIREARM DISCHARGE</h3>
    <p>Except during training or recreational use, any member who discharges a firearm intentionally or unintentionally, on- or off-duty, shall make a verbal report to his/her supervisor as soon as circumstances permit. If the discharge results in injury or death to another person, additional statements and reports shall be made in accordance with the Officer-Involved Shootings and Deaths Policy. If a firearm was discharged as a use of force, the involved member shall adhere to the additional reporting requirements set forth in the Use of Force Policy.</p>
    <p>In all other cases, written reports shall be made as follows:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">

        <li>If off-duty at the time of the incident, a written report shall be submitted or recorded statement provided no later than the end of the next regularly scheduled shift, unless otherwise directed by a supervisor.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>312.7.1 DESTRUCTION OF ANIMALS</h4>
    <p>Members are authorized to use firearms to stop an animal in circumstances where the animal reasonably appears to pose an imminent threat to human safety and alternative methods are not reasonably available or would likely be ineffective.</p>
    <p>In circumstances where there is sufficient advance notice that a potentially dangerous animal may be encountered, department members should develop reasonable contingency plans for dealing with the animal (e.g., fire extinguisher, Taser® device, oleoresin capsicum (OC) spray, animal control officer). Nothing in this policy shall prohibit any member from shooting a dangerous animal if circumstances reasonably dictate that a contingency plan has failed or becomes impractical.</p>
    <h4>312.7.2 INJURED ANIMALS</h4>
    <p>With the approval of a supervisor, a member may euthanize an animal that is so badly injured that human compassion requires its removal from further suffering and where other dispositions are impractical.</p>
    <h4>312.7.3 WARNING AND OTHER SHOTS</h4>
    <p>Warning shots are prohibited. Shots fired for the purpose of summoning aid are discouraged and may not be discharged unless the member reasonably believes that they appear necessary, effective and reasonably safe.</p>
    <h4>312.7.4 REPORTING FIREARMS DISCHARGE</h4>
    <p>The Chief of Police shall notify the Commissioner of Public Safety within 30 days of an on-duty firearm discharge, except when the discharge is in the course of training or destruction of animals (described in this policy). The notification shall contain information concerning the reason for and circumstances surrounding the discharge (Minn. Stat. § 626.553).</p>

    <h3>312.8 ARMORER / FIREARMS INSTRUCTOR DUTIES</h3>
    <p>The range will be under the exclusive control of the Armorer / Firearms Instructor. All members attending will follow the directions of the Armorer. The Armorer will maintain a roster of all members attending the range and will submit the roster to the Training Supervisor after each range date. Failure of any member to sign in and out with the Armorer may result in non-participation or non- qualification.</p>
    <p>The range shall remain operational and accessible to department members during hours established by the Department.</p>
    <p>The Armorer has the responsibility of making periodic inspection, at least once a year, of all duty firearms carried by members of this department to verify proper operation. The Armorer has the authority to deem any department-issued or privately owned firearm unfit for service. The member will be responsible for all repairs to his/her personally owned firearm; it will not be returned to service until inspected and approved by the Armorer.</p>
    <p>The Armorer has the responsibility for ensuring each member meets the minimum requirements during training shoots and, on at least a yearly basis, can demonstrate proficiency in the care, cleaning and safety of all firearms the member is authorized to carry.</p>
    <p>The Armorer shall complete and submit to the Training Supervisor documentation of the courses provided. Documentation shall include the qualifications of each instructor who provides the training, a description of the training provided and, on a form that has been approved by the Department, a list of each member who completes the training. The Armorer should keep accurate records of all training shoots, qualifications, repairs, maintenance or other records as directed by the Training Supervisor.</p>

    <h3>312.9 FLYING WHILE ARMED</h3>
    <p>The Transportation Security Administration (TSA) has imposed rules governing law enforcement officers flying armed on commercial aircraft. The following requirements apply to personnel who intend to be armed while flying on a commercial air carrier or flights where screening is conducted (49 CFR 1544.219):</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Officers wishing to fly while armed must be flying in an official capacity, not for vacation or pleasure and must have a need to have the firearm accessible, as determined by the Department based on the law and published TSA rules.</li>
        <li>Officers must carry their Metro Transit Police Department identification card, bearing the officer's name, a full-face photograph, identification number, the officer's signature and the signature of the Chief of Police or the official seal of the Department and must present this identification to airline officials when requested. The officer should also carry the standard photo identification needed for passenger screening by airline and TSA officials (e.g., driver’s license, passport).</li>
        <li>The Metro Transit Police Department must submit a National Law Enforcement Telecommunications System (NLETS) message prior to the officer’s travel. If approved, TSA will send the Metro Transit Police Department an NLETS message containing a unique alphanumeric identifier. The officer must present the message on the day of travel to airport personnel as authorization to travel while armed.</li>
        <li>An official letter signed by the Chief of Police authorizing armed travel may also accompany the officer. The letter should outline the officer’s need to fly armed, detail his/her itinerary and include that the officer has completed the mandatory TSA training for a law enforcement officer flying while armed.</li>
        <li>Officers must have completed the mandated TSA security training covering officers flying while armed. The training shall be given by the department-appointed instructor.</li>
        <li>It is the officer’s responsibility to notify the air carrier in advance of the intended armed travel. This notification can be accomplished by early check-in at the carrier’s check-in counter.</li>
        <li>Any officer flying while armed should discreetly contact the flight crew prior to take-off and notify them of his/her assigned seat.</li>
        <li>Discretion must be used to avoid alarming passengers or crew by displaying a firearm. The officer must keep the firearm concealed on his/her person at all times. Firearms are not permitted in carry-on luggage and may not be stored in an overhead compartment.</li>
        <li>Officers should resolve any problems associated with flying armed through the flight captain, ground security manager, TSA representative or other management representative of the air carrier.</li>
        <li>Officers shall not consume alcoholic beverages while aboard an aircraft, or within eight hours prior to boarding an aircraft.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>312.10 CARRYING FIREARMS OUT OF STATE</h3>
    <p>Qualified, active, full-time officers of this department are authorized to carry a concealed firearm in all other states subject to the following conditions (18 USC § 926B):</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>The officer shall carry his/her Metro Transit Police Department identification card whenever carrying such weapon.</li>
        <li>The officer is not the subject of any current disciplinary action.</li>
        <li>The officer may not be under the influence of alcohol or any other intoxicating or hallucinatory drug.</li>
        <li>The officer will remain subject to this and all other department policies (including qualifying and training).</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Officers are cautioned that individual states may enact local regulations that permit private persons or entities to prohibit or restrict the possession of concealed firearms on their property, or that prohibit or restrict the possession of firearms on any state or local government property, installation, building, base or park. Federal authority may not shield an officer from arrest and prosecution in such locally restricted areas.</p>
    <p>Active law enforcement officers from other states are subject to all requirements set forth in 18 USC § 926B.</p>
</div>

            <div class="chapter" id="314">
    <h2>314 - Vehicle Pursuits</h2>
    <h3>314.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>Vehicle pursuits expose innocent citizens, law enforcement officers and fleeing violators to the risk of serious injury or death. The primary purpose of this policy is to provide officers with guidance in balancing the safety of the public and themselves against law enforcement's duty to apprehend violators of the law. Another purpose of this policy is to minimize the potential for pursuit-related collisions. Vehicular pursuits require officers to exhibit a high degree of common sense and sound judgment. Officers must not forget that the immediate apprehension of a suspect is generally not more important than the safety of the public and pursuing officers (Minn. Stat. § 626.8458 Subd. 1).</p>
    <h4>314.1.1 PHILOSOPHY</h4>
    <p>Deciding whether to pursue a motor vehicle is a critical decision that must be made quickly and under difficult and unpredictable circumstances. In recognizing the risk to public safety created by vehicle pursuits, no officer or supervisor shall be criticized or disciplined for deciding not to engage in a vehicle pursuit due to the risk involved. This includes circumstances where Department policy would permit the initiation or continuation of the pursuit. It is recognized that vehicle pursuits are not always predictable and decisions made pursuant to this policy will be evaluated according to the totality of the circumstances reasonably available at the time of the pursuit (Minn. Stat. § 626.8458 Subd. 1).</p>
    <p>Officers must remember that the most important factors to the successful conclusion of a pursuit are proper self-discipline and sound professional judgment. Officers conduct during the course of a pursuit must be objectively reasonable; that is, what a reasonable officer would do under the circumstances. An individual’s unreasonable desire to apprehend a fleeing suspect at all costs has no place in professional law enforcement pursuit (Minn. Stat. § 626.8458 Subd. 2 (2)).</p>

    <h3>314.2 DEFINITIONS</h3>
    <p>Definitions related to this policy include:</p>
    <p><strong>Blocking or vehicle intercept</strong> - A slow-speed coordinated maneuver where two or more law enforcement vehicles simultaneously intercept and block the movement of a suspect vehicle, the driver of which may be unaware of the impending enforcement stop, with the goal of containment and preventing a pursuit. Blocking is not a moving or stationary road block.</p>
    <p><strong>Boxing-in</strong> - A tactic designed to stop a violator's vehicle by surrounding it with law enforcement vehicles and then slowing all vehicles to a stop.</p>
    <p><strong>Pursuit Intervention Technique (PIT)</strong> - A low-speed maneuver intended to terminate the pursuit by causing the violator's vehicle to spin out and come to a stop.</p>
    <p><strong>Ramming</strong> - The deliberate act of impacting a violator's vehicle with another vehicle to functionally damage or otherwise force the violator's vehicle to stop.</p>
    <p><strong>Roadblocks</strong> - A tactic designed to stop a violator's vehicle by intentionally placing a vehicle or other immovable object in the path of the violator's vehicle.</p>
    <p><strong>Spikes or tack strips</strong> - A device that extends across the roadway and is designed to puncture the tires of the pursued vehicle.</p>
    <p><strong>Terminate</strong> - When the officer discontinues the use of all emergency equipment, slows the marked squad car to the posted speed limit and turns off the pursuit route at the next available intersection or exit point.</p>
    <p><strong>Vehicle pursuit</strong> - An event in which a peace officer initiates a vehicular stop and a driver resists the signal or order to stop by increasing speed, taking evasive action or otherwise refusing to stop the vehicle.</p>

    <h3>314.3 OFFICER RESPONSIBILITIES</h3>
    <p>It is the policy of this department that a vehicle pursuit shall be conducted with at least one flashing red warning lamp visible from the front and a siren that is sounded when necessary to warn pedestrians or other drivers (Minn. Stat. § 169.17 and Minn. Stat. § 169.68).</p>
    <p>Operating an emergency vehicle in a pursuit with emergency lights and siren does not relieve the operator of an authorized emergency vehicle of the duty to drive with due regard for the safety of all persons, and does not protect the driver from the consequences of a reckless disregard for the safety of others.</p>
    <h4>314.3.1 WHEN TO INITIATE A PURSUIT</h4>
    <p>Officers are authorized to initiate a pursuit when it is reasonable to believe that a suspect is attempting to evade arrest or detention by fleeing in a vehicle that has been given a signal to stop by a peace officer.</p>
    <p>The following factors individually and collectively shall be considered in deciding whether to initiate or continue a pursuit (Minn. Stat. § 626.8458 Subd. 2(2); Minn. R. § 6700.2701):</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Seriousness of the known or reasonably suspected crime and its relationship to community safety.</li>
        <li>The importance of protecting the public and balancing the known or reasonably suspected offense and the apparent need for immediate capture against the risks to officers, innocent motorists and others.</li>
        <li>Apparent nature of the fleeing suspect (e.g., whether the suspect represents a serious threat to public safety).</li>
        <li>The identity of the suspect has been verified and there is comparatively minimal risk in allowing the suspect to be apprehended at a later time.</li>
        <li>Safety of the public in the area of the pursuit, including the type of area, time of day, the amount of vehicular and pedestrian traffic (e.g., school zones) and the speed of the pursuit relative to these factors.</li>
        <li>Pursuing officer's familiarity with the area of the pursuit, the quality of radio communications between the pursuing units and the dispatcher/supervisor, and the driving capabilities of the pursuing officers under the conditions of the pursuit.</li>
        <li>Weather, traffic and road conditions that unreasonably increase the danger of the pursuit when weighed against the risks resulting from the suspect's escape.</li>
        <li>Performance capabilities of the vehicles used in the pursuit in relation to the speeds and other conditions of the pursuit.</li>
        <li>Vehicle speeds.</li>
        <li>Other persons in or on the pursued vehicle (e.g., passengers, co-offenders and hostages).</li>
        <li>Age of the suspect and occupants.</li>
        <li>Availability of other resources, such as aircraft assistance.</li>
        <li>The police unit is carrying passengers other than on-duty police officers. Pursuits should not be undertaken with a prisoner in the pursuit vehicle unless exigent circumstances exist, and then only after the need to apprehend the suspect is weighed against the safety of the prisoner in transport. A unit containing more than a single prisoner should not participate in a pursuit.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>314.3.2 WHEN TO TERMINATE A PURSUIT</h4>
    <p>Pursuits should be discontinued whenever the totality of objective circumstances known or which reasonably ought to be known to the officer or supervisor during the pursuit indicates that the present risks of continuing the pursuit reasonably appear to outweigh the risks resulting from the suspect's escape.</p>
    <p>The above factors on when to initiate a pursuit are expressly included herein and will apply equally to the decision to discontinue as well as the decision to initiate a pursuit. Officers and supervisors must objectively and continuously weigh the seriousness of the offense against the potential danger to innocent motorists, themselves and the public when electing to continue a pursuit. In the context of this policy, the term “terminate” shall be construed to mean discontinue or to stop chasing the fleeing vehicle.</p>
    <p>In addition to the factors listed above, the following factors should be considered when deciding whether to terminate a pursuit (Minn. Stat. § 626.8458 Subd. 2 (2); Minn. R. § 6700.2701):</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Distance between the pursuing officers and the fleeing vehicle is so great that further pursuit would be futile or require the pursuit to continue for an unreasonable time or distance.</li>
        <li>Pursued vehicle's location is no longer definitely known.</li>
        <li>Officer's pursuit vehicle sustains damage or a mechanical failure that renders it unsafe to drive</li>
        <li>ursuit vehicle suffers an emergency equipment failure that causes the vehicle to no longer qualify for emergency operation use.</li>
        <li>Extended pursuits of violators for misdemeanors not involving abuse or risk of serious harm (independent of the pursuit) are discouraged.</li>
        <li>Hazards to uninvolved bystanders or motorists.</li>
        <li>If the identity of the offender is known and it does not reasonably appear that the need for immediate capture outweighs the risks associated with continuing the pursuit, officers should strongly consider discontinuing the pursuit and apprehending the offender at a later time.</li>
        <li>When radio communications are broken or inadequate.</li>
        <li>When the danger that the continued pursuit poses to the public, the officers or the suspect is too great, balanced against the risk of allowing the suspect to remain at large.</li>
        <li>When directed to terminate the pursuit by a supervisor.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>314.3.3 SPEED LIMITS</h4>
    <p>The speed of a pursuit is a factor that should be evaluated on a continuing basis by the officer and supervisor. Evaluation of vehicle speeds shall take into consideration public safety, officer safety and the safety of the occupants of the fleeing vehicle.</p>
    <p>Should high vehicle speeds be reached during a pursuit, officers and supervisors shall also consider these factors when determining the reasonableness of the speed of the pursuit:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Pursuit speeds have become unreasonably unsafe for the surrounding conditions.</li>
        <li>Pursuit speeds have exceeded the driving ability of the officer.</li>
        <li>Pursuit speeds are beyond the capabilities of the pursuit vehicle thus making its operation unsafe.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>314.4 PURSUIT UNITS</h3>
    <p>Pursuit units should be limited to three vehicles (two units and a supervisor). However, the number of units involved will vary with the circumstances (Minn. R. § 6700.2701 (B)).</p>
    <p>An officer or supervisor may request additional units to join a pursuit if, after assessing the factors outlined above, it appears that the number of officers involved would be insufficient to safely arrest the suspect(s). All other officers shall stay out of the pursuit but should remain alert to its progress and location. Any officer who drops out of a pursuit may then, if necessary, proceed to the termination point at legal speeds, following the appropriate rules of the road.</p>
    <p>Distinctively marked patrol vehicles should replace unmarked vehicles involved in a pursuit whenever practicable.</p>
    <h4>314.4.1 VEHICLES WITHOUT EMERGENCY EQUIPMENT</h4>
    <p>Vehicles not equipped with red light and siren are prohibited from initiating or joining in any pursuit. Officer(s) in such vehicles may provide support to pursuing units as long as their vehicle is operated in compliance with all traffic laws.</p>
    <h4>314.4.2 PRIMARY UNIT RESPONSIBILITIES</h4>
    <p>The initial pursuing officer will be designated as the primary pursuit unit and will be responsible for the conduct of the pursuit unless it is unable to remain reasonably close enough to the violator’s vehicle. The primary responsibility of the officer initiating the pursuit is the apprehension of the suspect(s) without unreasonable danger to him/herself or other persons (Minn. Stat. § 626.8458 Subd. 2 (4)).</p>
    <p>The primary unit should notify Transit Control Center, commencing with a request for priority radio traffic, that a vehicle pursuit has been initiated, and as soon as practicable provide information including, but not limited to:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Reason for the pursuit.</li>
        <li>Location and direction of travel.</li>
        <li>Speed of the fleeing vehicle.</li>
        <li>Description of the fleeing vehicle and license number, if known.</li>
        <li>Number of occupants.</li>
        <li>The identity or description of the known occupants.</li>
        <li>Weather, road and traffic conditions.</li>
        <li>Identity of other agencies involved in the pursuit.</li>
        <li>Information concerning the use of firearms, threat of force, injuries, hostages or other unusual hazards.</li>
        <li>Request for medical assistance for any person injured in the course of the pursuit (Minn. Stat. § 626.8458 Subd. 2 (6); Minn. R. § 6700.2701).</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Unless relieved by a supervisor or secondary unit, the officer in the primary unit shall be responsible for broadcasting the progress of the pursuit. Unless circumstances reasonably indicate otherwise, the primary unit should relinquish the responsibility of broadcasting the progress of the pursuit to a secondary unit or aircraft joining the pursuit to minimize distractions and allow the primary unit to concentrate foremost on safe pursuit tactics (Minn. R. § 6700.2701).</p>
    <h4>314.4.3 SECONDARY UNITS RESPONSIBILITIES</h4>
    <p>The second officer in the pursuit is responsible for the following (Minn. R. § 6700.2701):</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Immediately notifying the dispatcher of entry into the pursuit.</li>
        <li>Remaining at a safe distance behind the primary unit unless directed to assume the role of primary officer, or if the primary unit is unable to continue the pursuit.</p>
            <p><br></li>
        <li>Broadcasting the progress of the pursuit unless the situation indicates otherwise.</li>
        <li>Serve as backup to the primary unit once the subject has been stopped.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>314.4.4 PURSUIT DRIVING TACTICS</h4>
    <p>The decision to use or not use specific driving tactics requires the same assessment of considerations outlined in the factors to be considered concerning pursuit initiation and termination. The following are tactics for units involved in the pursuit (Minn. Stat. § 626.8458 Subd. 2 (2)):</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Officers, considering their driving skills and vehicle performance capabilities, will space themselves from other involved vehicles such that they are able to see and avoid hazards or react safely to maneuvers by the fleeing vehicle.</li>
        <li>Officers may proceed past a red or stop signal or stop sign but only after slowing down and utilizing a flashing red lamp or siren as may be necessary for safe operation (Minn. Stat. § 169.03, Subd. 2).</li>
        <li>As a general rule, officers should not pursue a vehicle driving the wrong way on a roadway, highway or freeway. In the event the pursued vehicle does so, the following tactics should be considered:</p>
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>Request assistance from an available air unit.</li>
                <li>Maintain visual contact with the pursued vehicle by paralleling on the correct side of the roadway.</li>
                <li>Request other units to observe exits available to the suspect(s).</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Notify the Minnesota State Patrol or other law enforcement agency if it appears the pursuit may enter their jurisdiction.</li>
        <li>Officers involved in a pursuit should not attempt to pass other units unless the situation indicates otherwise or they are requested to do so by the primary unit, and a clear understanding of the maneuver process exists between the involved officers.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>314.4.5 TACTICS/PROCEDURES FOR UNITS NOT INVOLVED IN THE PURSUIT</h4>
    <p>There should be no paralleling of the pursuit route. Officers are authorized to use emergency equipment at intersections along the pursuit path to clear intersections of vehicular and pedestrian traffic to protect the public. Officers should remain in their assigned area and should not become involved with the pursuit unless directed otherwise by a supervisor.</p>
    <p>Non-pursuing personnel needed at the termination of the pursuit should respond in a non- emergency manner, observing the rules of the road.</p>
    <p>The primary unit, secondary unit and supervisor should be the only units operating under emergency conditions (emergency lights and siren) unless other units are assigned to the pursuit.</p>
    <h4>314.4.6 PURSUIT TRAILING</h4>
    <p>In the event the initiating unit from this agency relinquishes control of the pursuit to another unit or jurisdiction, that initiating unit may, with permission of a supervisor, trail the pursuit to the termination point in order to provide necessary information and assistance for the arrest of the suspect(s).</p>
    <p>The term "trail" means to follow the path of the pursuit at a safe speed while obeying all traffic laws and without activating emergency equipment. If the pursuit is at a slow rate of speed, the trailing unit will maintain sufficient distance from the pursuit units so as to clearly indicate an absence of participation in the pursuit.</p>
    <h4>314.4.7 AIRCRAFT ASSISTANCE</h4>
    <p>When available, aircraft assistance should be requested. Once the air unit has established visual contact with the pursued vehicle, it should assume control over the pursuit. The primary and secondary ground units should consider whether the participation of an aircraft warrants their continued involvement in the pursuit (Minn. Stat. § 626.8458 Subd. 2 (4)).</p>
    <p>The air unit should coordinate the activities of resources on the ground, report progress of the pursuit and provide officers and supervisors with details of upcoming traffic congestion, road hazards or other pertinent information to evaluate whether to continue the pursuit. If ground units are not within visual contact and the air unit determines that it is unsafe to continue the pursuit, the air unit should recommend terminating the pursuit.</p>

    <h3>314.5 SUPERVISORY CONTROL AND RESPONSIBILITIES</h3>
    <p>It is the policy of this department that available supervisory and management control will be exercised over all vehicle pursuits involving officers from this department (Minn. Stat. § 626.8458 Subd. 2 (4); Minn. R. § 6700.2701).</p>
    <p>The field supervisor of the officer initiating the pursuit, or if unavailable, the nearest field supervisor will be responsible for the following:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Upon becoming aware of a pursuit, immediately notify involved officers and Transit Control Center of supervisory presence and ascertaining all reasonably available information to continuously assess the situation and risk factors associated with the pursuit in order to ensure that the pursuit is conducted within established Department guidelines.</li>
        <li>Engage in the pursuit, when appropriate, to provide on-scene supervision.</li>
        <li>Exercise management and control of the pursuit even if not engaged in it.</li>
        <li>Ensure that no more than the number of required law enforcement units needed are involved in the pursuit under the guidelines set forth in this policy.</li>
        <li>Direct that the pursuit be terminated if, in his/her judgment, it is not justified to continue the pursuit under the guidelines of this policy.</li>
        <li>Ensure that aircraft assistance is requested if available.</li>
        <li>Ensure that the proper radio channel is being used.</li>
        <li>Ensure the notification and/or coordination of outside agencies if the pursuit either leaves or is likely to leave the jurisdiction of this agency.</li>
        <li>Control and manage MTPD units when a pursuit enters another jurisdiction.</li>
        <li>Prepare a post-pursuit critique and analysis of the pursuit for training purposes.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>314.5.1 SHIFT SUPERVISOR RESPONSIBILITIES</h4>
    <p>Upon becoming aware that a pursuit has been initiated, the Shift Supervisor should monitor and continually assess the situation and ensure the pursuit is conducted within the guidelines and requirements of this policy. The Shift Supervisor has the final responsibility for the coordination, control and termination of a vehicle pursuit and shall be in overall command (Minn. Stat. § 626.8458 Subd. 2 (4); Minn. R. § 6700.2701).</p>
    <p>The Shift Supervisor shall review all pertinent reports for content and forward them to the Captain.</p>

    <h3>314.6 COMMUNICATIONS</h3>
    <p>If the pursuit is confined within the Metropolitan Transit Police Department area limits, radio communications will be conducted on the primary channel unless instructed otherwise by a supervisor or communications dispatcher. If the pursuit leaves the jurisdiction of this department or such is imminent, involved units should, whenever available, switch radio communications to an emergency channel most accessible by participating agencies and units (e.g. local agency channel and/or P-Tac 1) (Minn. R. § 6700.2701).</p>
    <h4>314.6.1 TRANSIT CONTROL CENTER RESPONSIBILITIES</h4>
    <p>Upon notification that a pursuit has been initiated, Transit Control Center will be responsible for the following (Minn. Stat. § 626.8458 Subd. 2 (4)):</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Coordinate pursuit communications of the involved units and personnel.</li>
        <li>Notify and coordinate with other involved or affected agencies as practicable.</li>
        <li>Ensure that a field supervisor is notified of the pursuit.</li>
        <li>Assign an incident number and log all pursuit activities.</li>
        <li>Broadcast pursuit updates as well as other pertinent information as necessary.</li>
        <li>Notify the Shift Supervisor as soon as practicable.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>314.6.2 LOSS OF PURSUED VEHICLE</h4>
    <p>When the pursued vehicle is lost, the primary unit should broadcast pertinent information to assist other units in locating the vehicle. The primary unit will be responsible for coordinating any further search for either the pursued vehicle or suspects fleeing on foot.</p>

    <h3>314.7 INTER-JURISDICTIONAL CONSIDERATIONS</h3>
    <p>When a pursuit enters another agency's jurisdiction, the primary officer or supervisor, taking into consideration distance traveled, unfamiliarity with the area and other pertinent facts, should determine whether to request the other agency to assume the pursuit. Unless entry into another jurisdiction is expected to be brief, it is generally recommended that the primary officer or supervisor ensure that notification is provided to the dispatcher and to each outside jurisdiction into which the pursuit is reasonably expected to enter, regardless of whether such jurisdiction is expected to assist (Minn. Stat. § 626.8458 Subd. 2 (5); Minn. R. § 6700.2701).</p>
    <p>If a pursuit from another agency enters the Department’s jurisdiction, if aware, the Transit Control Center should update the on-duty supervisor.</p>
    <h4>314.7.1 ASSUMPTION OF PURSUIT BY ANOTHER AGENCY</h4>
    <p>Metro Transit Police Department officers will discontinue the pursuit when another agency has assumed the pursuit unless continued assistance of the Metro Transit Police Department is requested by the agency assuming the pursuit. Upon discontinuing the pursuit, the primary unit may proceed upon request, with or at the direction of a supervisor, to the termination point to assist in the investigation.</p>
    <p>The role and responsibilities of officers at the termination of a pursuit initiated by this department shall be coordinated with appropriate consideration of the units from the agency assuming the pursuit.</p>
    <p>Notification of a pursuit in progress should not be construed as a request to join the pursuit. Requests to or from another agency to assume a pursuit should be specific. Because of communication limitations between local agencies, a request for another agency's assistance will mean that its personnel will assume responsibilities for the pursuit. For the same reasons, when a pursuit leaves another jurisdiction and a request for assistance is made to this department, the other agency should relinquish control.</p>
    <h4>314.7.2 PURSUITS EXTENDING INTO THIS JURISDICTION</h4>
    <p>The agency that initiates a pursuit shall be responsible for conducting the pursuit. Units from this department should not join a pursuit unless specifically requested to do so by the agency whose peace officers are in pursuit. An exception to being specifically requested to join a pursuit, is if the initiating agency has only a single unit in the pursuit. Under this circumstance, and if authorized by a supervisor, a unit from this department may join the pursuit until sufficient units from the initiating agency join the pursuit.</p>
    <p>When a request is made for this department to assist or take over a pursuit from another agency that has entered this jurisdiction, the supervisor should consider these additional following factors:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Ability to maintain the pursuit.</li>
        <li>Circumstances serious enough to continue the pursuit.</li>
        <li>Adequate staffing to continue the pursuit.</li>
        <li>The public's safety within this jurisdiction.</li>
        <li>Safety of the pursuing officers.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>As soon as practicable, the Shift Supervisor should review a request for assistance from another agency. The Shift Supervisor, after consideration of the above factors, may decline to assist in or assume the other agency's pursuit.</p>
    <p>Assistance to a pursuing outside agency by officers of this department will terminate when the supervisor orders the termination or when the pursuing peace officers have sufficient assistance from other sources. Ongoing participation from this department may continue only until sufficient assistance is present.</p>
    <p>In the event that a pursuit from another agency terminates within the Metro Transit Police Department's jurisdiction, officers shall provide appropriate assistance to peace officers from the outside agency including, but not limited to, scene control, coordination and completion of supplemental reports and any other assistance requested or needed.</p>

    <h3>314.8 PURSUIT INTERVENTION</h3>
    <p>Pursuit intervention is an attempt to terminate the ability of a suspect to continue to flee in a motor vehicle through tactical application of technology, road spikes, blocking, boxing, PIT (Pursuit Intervention Technique), ramming or roadblock procedures.</p>
    <h4>314.8.1 WHEN USE AUTHORIZED</h4>
    <p>Use of pursuit intervention tactics should be employed only after approval of a supervisor. In deciding whether to use intervention tactics, officers/supervisors should balance the risks of allowing the pursuit to continue with the potential hazards arising from the use of each tactic to the public, the officers and persons in or on the pursued vehicle. With these risks in mind, the decision to use any intervention tactic should be reasonable in light of the circumstances apparent to the officer at the time of the decision (Minn. Stat. § 626.8458 Subd. 2; Minn. R. § 6700.2701).</p>
    <p>It is imperative that officers act within legal bounds using good judgment and accepted practices.</p>
    <h4>314.8.2 USE OF FIREARMS</h4>
    <p>The use of firearms to disable a pursued vehicle is not generally an effective tactic and involves all the dangers associated with discharging firearms. Officers should not utilize firearms during an ongoing pursuit unless the conditions and circumstances meet the requirements authorizing the use of deadly force. Nothing in this section shall be construed to prohibit any officer from using a firearm to stop a suspect from using a vehicle as a deadly weapon.</p>
    <h4>314.8.3 INTERVENTION STANDARDS</h4>
    <p>Any pursuit intervention tactic, depending upon the conditions and circumstances under which it is used, may present dangers to the officers, the public or anyone in or on the vehicle being pursued. Certain applications of intervention tactics may be construed to be a use of force, including deadly force, and are subject to Department policies guiding such use. Officers who have not received Department-approved training in the application and use of any intervention tactic or</p>
    <p>equipment shall consider these facts and requirements prior to deciding how, when, where and if an intervention tactic should be employed.</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Blocking or vehicle intercept should only be considered in cases involving felony suspects or impaired drivers who pose a threat to public safety when officers reasonably believe that attempting a conventional enforcement stop will likely result in the driver attempting to flee in the vehicle. Because of the potential risks involved, this technique should only be employed by officers who have received training in such tactics and after giving consideration to the following:
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>The need to immediately stop the suspect vehicle or prevent it from leaving substantially outweighs the risks of injury or death to occupants of the suspect vehicle, officers or other members of the public.</li>
                <li>All other reasonable intervention techniques have failed or reasonably appear ineffective.</li>
                <li>Employing the blocking maneuver does not unreasonably increase the risk to officer safety.</li>
                <li>The target vehicle is stopped or traveling at a low speed.</li>
                <li>At no time should civilian vehicles be used to deploy this technique.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Only those officers trained in the use of the PIT will be authorized to use this procedure and only then with approval of a supervisor upon consideration of the circumstances and conditions presented at the time, including the potential for risk of injury to officers, the public and occupants of the pursued vehicle.</li>
        <li>Ramming a fleeing vehicle should be done only after other reasonable tactical means at the officer's disposal have been exhausted. This tactic should be reserved for situations where there does not appear to be another reasonable alternative method. This policy is an administrative guide to direct officers in their decision-making process before ramming another vehicle. When ramming is used as a means to stop a fleeing vehicle, the following factors should be present:
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>The suspect is an actual or suspected felon, who reasonably appears to represent a serious threat to the public if not apprehended.</li>
                <li>The suspect is driving with willful or wanton disregard for the safety of other persons or is driving in a reckless and life-endangering manner.</li>
                <li>If there does not reasonably appear to be a present or immediately foreseeable serious threat to the public, the use of ramming is not authorized.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>As with all intervention techniques, pursuing officers should obtain supervisor approval before attempting to box a suspect vehicle during a pursuit. The use of such a technique must be carefully coordinated with all involved units, taking into consideration the circumstances and conditions apparent at the time, as well as the potential risk of injury to officers, the public and occupants of the pursued vehicle.</li>
        <li>Spike strips should be deployed only when it is reasonably apparent that only the pursued vehicle will be affected by their use. Prior to the deployment of spike strips, the officer shall notify pursuing units and the supervisor of the intent and location. Officers should carefully consider the limitations of such devices as well as the potential risks to officers, the public and occupants of the pursued vehicle. If the pursued vehicle is a motorcycle, a vehicle transporting hazardous materials or a school bus transporting children officers and supervisors should weigh the potential consequences against the need to immediately stop the vehicle.</li>
        <li>Because roadblocks involve a potential for serious injury or death to occupants of the pursued vehicle if the suspect does not stop, the intentional placement of roadblocks in the direct path of a pursued vehicle is generally discouraged and should not be deployed without prior approval of a supervisor, and only then under extraordinary conditions when all other reasonable intervention techniques have failed or reasonably appear ineffective and the need to immediately stop the pursued vehicle substantially outweighs the risks of injury or death to occupants of the pursued vehicle, officers or other members of the public.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>314.8.4 CAPTURE OF SUSPECTS</h4>
    <p>Proper self-discipline and sound professional judgment are the keys to a successful conclusion of a pursuit and apprehension of evading suspects. Officers shall use only that amount of force that reasonably appears necessary under the circumstances to properly perform their lawful duties.</p>
    <p>Unless relieved by a supervisor, the primary officer should coordinate efforts to apprehend the suspect(s) following the pursuit. Officers should consider safety of the public and the involved officers when formulating plans to contain and capture the suspect.</p>

    <h3>314.9 REPORTING AND REVIEW REQUIREMENTS</h3>
    <p>All appropriate reports shall be completed to comply with appropriate local and state regulations. The Records Supervisor shall ensure the appropriate forms are filed with the Department of Public Safety within 30 days (Minn. Stat. § 626.5532):</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>The primary officer shall complete appropriate crime/arrest reports.</li>
        <li>The primary officer or supervisor shall complete the appropriate pursuit report.</li>
        <li>After first obtaining available information, the on-duty field supervisor shall promptly complete a Supervisor's Log or interoffice memorandum, briefly summarizing the pursuit to the Chief of Police or designee. This memo should minimally contain the following information (Minn. Stat. § 626.5532):
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>Date and time of pursuit.</li>
                <li>Length of pursuit in distance and time.</li>
                <li>Involved units and officers.</li>
                <li>Initial reason and circumstances surrounding the pursuit.</li>

                <li>A preliminary determination that the pursuit appears to be in compliance with this policy or additional review and/or follow-up is warranted.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>After receiving copies of reports, logs and other pertinent information, the Chief of Police or designee shall conduct or assign the completion of a post-pursuit review as appropriate to the circumstances.</li>
        <li>Annually, the Chief of Police should direct a documented review and analysis of Department vehicle pursuits to minimally include policy suitability, policy compliance and training needs.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>314.9.1 REGULAR AND PERIODIC PURSUIT TRAINING</h4>
    <p>In addition to initial and supplementary training on pursuits, all licensed non-exempt employees will participate, no less than annually, in regular and periodic training on this policy and the importance of vehicle safety and protecting the public at all times. Training will include a recognition of the need to balance the known offense and the need for immediate capture against the risks to officers and others.</p>
    <p>The Training Coordinator shall ensure the frequency and content of emergency vehicle operations and vehicle pursuit training meets or exceeds that required by law (Minn. Stat. § 626.8458 Subd. 5; Minn. R. § 6700.2702).</p>

            <div class="chapter" id="316">
    <h2>316 - Officer Response to Calls</h2>
    <h3>316.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>The State of Minnesota finds that emergency vehicle operations are an integral part of law enforcement’s commitment to public safety. This policy provides for the safe and appropriate response to all emergency and non-emergency situations (Minn. Stat. § 626.8458 Subd. 1).</p>

    <h3>316.2 RESPONSE TO CALLS</h3>
    <h4>316.2.1 RESPONSE TO EMERGENCY CALLS</h4>
    <p>Officers responding to an emergency call shall proceed immediately as appropriate. Officers responding to an emergency call shall sound the siren or display at least one lighted red light to the front of the vehicle. Whenever practicable, during an emergency call response the officer should continuously operate emergency lighting equipment and sound the siren (Minn. Stat. § 169.03 et seq.; Minn. Stat. § 169.17).</p>
    <p>Responding with a red light, emergency lighting and/or siren does not relieve the operator of an authorized emergency vehicle or a law enforcement vehicle of the duty to drive with due regard for the safety of all persons and does not protect the driver from the consequences of his/her reckless disregard for the safety of others. The use of any other warning equipment without emergency lights and siren does not provide an exemption under Minnesota law (Minn. Stat. § 169.17).</p>
    <p>Officers should only respond with a red light, emergency lights and/or siren when so dispatched or when circumstances reasonably indicate an emergency response is appropriate. Officers not responding with a red light, emergency lights and/or siren shall observe all traffic laws.</p>
    <h4>316.2.2 LIGHTING EXEMPTION OF LAW ENFORCEMENT VEHICLES</h4>
    <p>An officer may operate a vehicle without lights as otherwise required when (Minn. Stat. § 169.541):</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>It is reasonable for the officer to do so under the circumstances.</li>
        <li>The officer reasonably believes that operating the vehicle without lights is necessary to investigate a criminal violation or suspected criminal violation of state laws, rules or orders, or local laws, ordinances or regulations; and</li>
        <li>There are no conditions of limited or reduced visibility (defined in Minn. Stat. § 84.87; Minn. Stat. § 84.928; Minn. Stat. § 169.48-169.65; Minn. Stat. § 86B.511); and the officer is not driving:
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>On an interstate highway.</li>
                <li>At speeds greater than what is reasonable and prudent under existing weather, road and traffic conditions.</li>
                <li>Faster than the posted speed limit.</li>
                <li>In situations where the peace officer is an active participant in the pursuit of a motor vehicle in violation of Minn. Stat. § 609.487.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>316.3 REQUESTING EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE</h3>
    <p>Requests for emergency assistance should be limited to those situations where the involved personnel reasonably believe that there is an imminent threat to the safety of officers, or assistance is needed to prevent imminent serious harm to a citizen. Where a situation has stabilized and emergency response is not required, the requesting officer shall promptly notify Transit Control Center.</p>
    <p>If circumstances permit, the requesting officer should give the following information:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The unit number</li>
        <li>The location</li>
        <li>The reason for the request and type of emergency</li>
        <li>The number of units required</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>316.3.1 NUMBER OF UNITS PARTICIPATING</h4>
    <p>Normally, only those units reasonably necessary should respond to an emergency as an emergency call response. The Shift Supervisor or the field supervisor should monitor all emergency responses and reduce or enhance the response as warranted.</p>

    <h3>316.4 RESPONSIBILITIES OF RESPONDING OFFICERS</h3>
    <p>Officers shall exercise sound judgment and care with due regard for life and property when responding to an emergency call. During a response to an emergency call officers may (Minn. Stat. § 169.03; Minn. Stat. § 169.17):</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Proceed cautiously past a red or stop signal or stop sign but only after slowing down and utilizing a red light or siren as may be necessary for safe operation.</li>
        <li>Exceed any speed limits, provided this does not endanger life or property.</li>
        <li>Disregard regulations governing direction of movement or turning in specified directions as authorized by law.</li>
        <li>Disregard regulations governing parking or standing when using a warning lamp.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The decision to continue an emergency call response is at the discretion of the officer. If, in the officer's judgment, the roadway conditions or traffic congestion does not permit such a response without unreasonable risk, the officer may elect to respond to the call without the use of red lights and siren at the legal speed limit. In such an event, the officer should immediately notify Transit Control Center. An officer shall also discontinue an emergency call response when directed by a supervisor or as otherwise appropriate.</p>
    <p>Upon determining that an emergency call response is appropriate, an officer shall immediately give the location from which he/she is responding.</p>
    <p>When emergency vehicles are on the scene of an emergency and pose any hazard, or when the vehicle operators seek exemption to park, stop or stand contrary to any law or ordinance pursuant to Minn. Stat. § 169.541, adequate warning lights shall be operated whenever practicable.</p>

    <h3>316.5 COMMUNICATIONS RESPONSIBILITIES</h3>
    <p>A dispatcher shall ensure acknowledgment and response of assisting units when an officer requests emergency assistance or when the available information reasonably indicates that the public is threatened with serious injury or death and an immediate law enforcement response is needed. In all other circumstances, the dispatcher shall obtain authorization from the Shift Supervisor prior to assigning an emergency response. The dispatcher shall:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Attempt to assign the closest available unit to the location requiring assistance.</li>
        <li>Immediately notify the Shift Supervisor (if applicable).</li>
        <li>Confirm the location from which the unit is responding.</li>
        <li>Notify and coordinate outside emergency services (e.g., local agency police, fire and ambulance).</li>
        <li>Continue to obtain and broadcast information as necessary concerning the response, and monitor the situation until it is stabilized or terminated.</li>
        <li>Control all radio communications during the emergency and coordinate assistance under the direction of the Shift Supervisor.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>316.6 SUPERVISORY RESPONSIBILITIES</h3>
    <p>Upon being notified that an emergency response has been initiated, the Shift Supervisor shall verify the following:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>The proper response has been initiated.</li>
        <li>No more than those units reasonably necessary under the circumstances are involved in the response.</li>
        <li>Affected outside jurisdictions are being notified as practicable.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The Shift Supervisor shall, whenever practicable, monitor the response until it has been stabilized or terminated and assert control by directing units into or out of the response if necessary. If, in the supervisor's judgment, the circumstances require additional units to be assigned an emergency response, the supervisor may do so.</p>
    <p>It is the supervisor's responsibility to terminate an emergency response that, in his/her judgment, is inappropriate due to the circumstances.</p>
    <p>When making the decision to authorize an emergency call response, the Shift Supervisor should consider the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The type of call or crime involved.</li>
        <li>The necessity of a timely response.</li>
        <li>Traffic and roadway conditions.</li>
        <li>The location of the responding units.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>316.7 FAILURE OF EMERGENCY EQUIPMENT</h3>
    <p>If the emergency equipment on the vehicle should fail to operate, the officer must terminate the emergency call response and respond accordingly. The officer shall notify the Shift Supervisor and the Transit Control Center of the equipment failure so that another unit may be assigned to the emergency response.</p>

    <h3>316.8 TRAINING</h3>
    <p>The Training Coordinator shall ensure the frequency and content of emergency vehicle operations training meets or exceeds that required by law (Minn. Stat. § 626.8458).</p>
</div>

            <div class="chapter" id="318">
    <h2>318 - Canines</h2>
    <h3>318.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>This policy establishes guidelines for the use of canines to augment law enforcement services to the community including, but not limited to, locating individuals and contraband and apprehending criminal offenders.</p>

    <h3>318.2 POLICY</h3>
    <p>It is the policy of the Metro Transit Police Department that teams of handlers and canines meet and maintain the appropriate proficiency to effectively and reasonably carry out legitimate law enforcement objectives.</p>

    <h3>318.3 ASSIGNMENT</h3>
    <p>Canine teams should be assigned to assist and supplement the Patrol Division. However, they may be assigned by the Shift Supervisor to other functions such as routine calls for service based on the current operational needs.</p>
    <p>Canine teams should generally not be assigned to handle routine matters that will take them out of service for extended periods of time and then only with the approval of the Shift Supervisor.</p>

    <h3>318.4 CANINE COORDINATOR</h3>
    <p>The canine coordinator shall be appointed by and directly responsible to the Patrol Captain or the authorized designee.</p>
    <p>The responsibilities of the coordinator include, but are not limited to:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Reviewing all canine use reports to ensure compliance with policy and to identify training issues and other needs of the program.</li>
        <li>Maintaining liaison with the vendor kennel(s).</li>
        <li>Maintaining liaison with command staff and functional supervisors.</li>
        <li>Maintaining liaison with other agency canine coordinators.</li>
        <li>Maintaining accurate records to document canine activities.</li>
        <li>Recommending and overseeing the procurement of equipment and services for the teams of handlers and canines.</li>
        <li>Scheduling all canine-related activities.</li>
        <li>Ensuring the canine teams are scheduled for regular training to maximize their capabilities.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>318.5 REQUESTS FOR CANINE TEAMS</h3>
    <p>Patrol Division members are encouraged to request the use of a canine. Requests for a canine team from department units outside of the Patrol Division shall be reviewed by the Shift Supervisor.</p>
    <h4>318.5.1 OUTSIDE AGENCY REQUEST</h4>
    <p>All requests for canine assistance from outside agencies must be approved by the Shift Supervisor and are subject to the following:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Canine teams shall not be used for any assignment that is not consistent with this policy.</li>
        <li>The canine handler shall have the authority to decline a request for any specific assignment that he/she deems unsuitable.</li>
        <li>Calling out off-duty canine teams is discouraged.</li>
        <li>It shall be the responsibility of the canine handler to coordinate operations with agency personnel in order to minimize the risk of unintended injury.</li>
        <li>It shall be the responsibility of the canine handler to complete all necessary reports or as directed.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>318.5.2 PUBLIC DEMONSTRATIONS</h4>
    <p>All public requests for a canine team shall be reviewed and, if appropriate, approved by the canine coordinator prior to making any resource commitment. The canine coordinator is responsible for obtaining resources and coordinating involvement in the demonstration to include proper safety protocols. Canine handlers shall not demonstrate any apprehension work unless authorized to do so by the canine coordinator.</p>

    <h3>318.6 APPREHENSION GUIDELINES</h3>
    <p>A canine may be used to locate and apprehend a suspect if the canine handler reasonably believes that the individual has either committed, is committing or threatening to commit any serious offense and if any of the following conditions exist:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>There is a reasonable belief the suspect poses an imminent threat of violence or serious harm to the public, any officer or the handler.</li>
        <li>The suspect is physically resisting or threatening to resist arrest and the use of a canine reasonably appears to be necessary to overcome such resistance.</li>
        <li>The suspect is believed to be concealed in an area where entry by other than the canine would pose a threat to the safety of officers or the public.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>It is recognized that situations may arise that do not fall within the provisions set forth in this policy. Such events require consideration of the totality of the circumstances and the use of an objective reasonableness standard applied to the decision to use a canine.</p>
    <p>Absent a reasonable belief that a suspect has committed, is committing or threatening to commit a serious offense mere flight from a pursuing officer without any of the above conditions shall not serve as the basis for the use of a canine to apprehend a suspect.</p>
    <p>Use of a canine to locate and apprehend a suspect wanted for a lesser criminal offense than those identified above requires approval from the Shift Supervisor. Absent a change in circumstances that present an imminent threat to officers the canine or the public, such canine use should be conducted on-leash or under conditions that minimize the likelihood the canine will bite or otherwise injure the individual.</p>
    <p>In all applications once the suspect has been located and no longer reasonably appears to present a threat or risk of escape the handler should secure the canine as soon as it becomes reasonably practicable. If the canine has apprehended the suspect with a secure bite, the handler should promptly command the canine to release the suspect.</p>
    <h4>318.6.1 PREPARATION FOR DEPLOYMENT</h4>
    <p>Prior to the use of a canine to search for or apprehend any suspect the canine handler and/or the supervisor on-scene should carefully consider all pertinent information reasonably available at the time. The information should include, but is not limited to:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>The nature and seriousness of the suspected offense.</li>
        <li>Whether violence or weapons were used or are anticipated.</li>
        <li>The degree of resistance or threatened resistance, if any, the suspect has shown.</li>
        <li>The suspect’s known or perceived age.</li>
        <li>The potential for injury to officers or the public caused by the suspect if the canine is not utilized.</li>
        <li>Any potential danger to the public and/or other officers at the scene if the canine is released.</li>
        <li>The potential for the suspect to escape or flee if the canine is not utilized.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>As circumstances permit the canine handler should make every reasonable effort to communicate and coordinate with other involved members to minimize the risk of unintended injury.</p>
    <p>It is the canine handler’s responsibility to evaluate each situation and determine whether the use of a canine is appropriate and reasonable. The canine handler shall have the authority to decline the use of the canine whenever he/she deems deployment is unsuitable.</p>
    <p>A supervisor who is sufficiently apprised of the situation may prohibit deploying the canine.</p>
    <p>Unless otherwise directed by a supervisor assisting members should take direction from the handler in order to minimize interference with the canine.</p>
    <h4>318.6.2 WARNINGS AND ANNOUNCEMENTS</h4>
    <p>Unless it would increase the risk of injury or escape a clearly audible warning announcing that a canine will be used if the suspect does not surrender should be made prior to releasing a canine. The handler should allow a reasonable time for a suspect to surrender and should quiet the canine momentarily to listen for any verbal response to the warning. If reasonably feasible, other members should be in a location opposite the warning to verify that the announcement could be heard. If available, warnings given in other languages should be used as necessary.</p>
    <p>If a warning is not to be given, the canine handler when reasonably practicable should first advise the supervisor of his/her decision before releasing the canine. In the event of an apprehension the handler shall document in any related report how the warning was given and, if none was given, the reasons why.</p>
    <h4>318.6.3 REPORTING DEPLOYMENTS, BITES AND INJURIES</h4>
    <p>Whenever a canine deployment results in a bite or causes injury to an intended suspect a supervisor should be promptly notified and the injuries documented in a canine use report. The injured person shall be promptly treated by emergency medical services personnel and, if appropriate, transported to an appropriate medical facility for further treatment. The deployment and injuries should also be included in any related incident or arrest report.</p>
    <p>Any unintended bite or injury caused by a canine, whether on- or off-duty, shall be promptly reported to the canine coordinator. Unintended bites or injuries caused by a canine should be documented in an administrative report, not in a canine use report.</p>
    <p>If an individual alleges an injury, either visible or not visible, a supervisor shall be notified and both the individual’s injured and uninjured areas shall be photographed as soon as reasonably practicable after first tending to the immediate needs of the injured party. Photographs shall be retained as evidence in accordance with current department evidence procedures. The photographs shall be retained until the criminal proceeding is completed and the time for any related civil proceeding has expired.</p>
    <p>Canines used by law enforcement agencies are generally exempt from dangerous dog registration, impoundment and reporting requirements (Minn. Stat. § 347.51, Subd. 4).</p>

    <h3>318.7 NON-APPREHENSION GUIDELINES</h3>
    <p>Properly trained canines may be used to track or search for non-criminals (e.g., lost children, individuals who may be disoriented or in need of medical attention). The canine handler is responsible for determining the canine’s suitability for such assignments based on the conditions and the particular abilities of the canine. When the canine is deployed in a search or other non- apprehension operation the following guidelines apply.</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Absent a change in circumstances that present an immediate threat to officers the canine or the public, such applications should be conducted on-leash or under conditions that minimize the likelihood the canine will bite or otherwise injure the individual, if located.</li>
        <li>Unless otherwise directed by a supervisor assisting members should take direction from the handler in order to minimize interference with the canine.</li>
        <li>Throughout the deployment the handler should periodically give verbal assurances that the canine will not bite or hurt the individual and encourage the individual to make him/herself known.</li>
        <li>Once the individual has been located the canine should be placed in a down-stay or otherwise secured as soon as it becomes reasonably practicable.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>318.7.1 ARTICLE DETECTION</h4>
    <p>A canine trained to find objects or property related to a person or crime may be used to locate or identify articles. A canine search should be conducted in a manner that minimizes the likelihood of unintended bites or injuries.</p>
    <h4>318.7.2 NARCOTICS DETECTION</h4>
    <p>A canine trained in narcotics detection may be used in accordance with current law and under certain circumstances, including:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>The search of vehicles, buildings, bags and other articles.</li>
        <li>Assisting in the search for narcotics during a search warrant service.</li>
        <li>Obtaining a search warrant by using the narcotics-detection trained canine in support of probable cause.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>A narcotics-detection trained canine will not be used to search a person for narcotics unless the canine is trained to passively indicate the presence of narcotics.</p>
    <h4>318.7.3 BOMB/EXPLOSIVE DETECTION</h4>
    <p>Because of the high risk of danger to the public and officers when a bomb or other explosive device is suspected, the use of a canine team trained in explosive detection may be considered. When available an explosive-detection canine team may be used in accordance with current law and under certain circumstances, including:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Assisting in the search of a building, structure, area, vehicle or article where an actual or suspected explosive device has been reported or located.</li>
        <li>Assisting with searches at transportation facilities and vehicles (e.g., buses, airplanes and trains).</li>
        <li>Preventive searches at special events, VIP visits, official buildings and other restricted areas. Searches of individuals should remain minimally intrusive and shall be strictly limited to the purpose of detecting explosives.</li>
        <li>Assisting in the search of scenes where an explosion has occurred and an explosive device or secondary explosive device is suspected.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>At no time will an explosive-detection trained canine be used to render a suspected device safe or clear.</p>

    <h3>318.8 HANDLER SELECTION</h3>
    <p>The minimum qualifications for the assignment of canine handler include:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>An officer who is currently off probation.</li>

        <li>Any changes in the living status of the handler that may affect the lodging or environment of the canine shall be reported to the canine coordinator as soon as possible.</li>
        <li>When off-duty the canine shall be in a kennel provided by the MTPD at the home of the handler. When a canine is kenneled at the handler’s home the gate shall be secured with a lock. When off-duty the canine may be let out of the kennel while under the direct control of the handler.</li>
        <li>The canine should be permitted to socialize in the home with the handler’s family for short periods of time and under the direct supervision of the handler.</li>
        <li>Under no circumstances will the canine be lodged at another location unless approved by the canine coordinator or Shift Supervisor.</li>
        <li>When off-duty the handler shall not involve the canine in any law enforcement activity or official conduct unless approved in advance by the canine coordinator or Shift Supervisor.</li>
        <li>Whenever a canine handler is off-duty for an extended number of days it may be necessary to temporarily relocate the canine. In those situations the handler shall give reasonable notice to the canine coordinator so that appropriate arrangements can be made.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>318.9.1 CANINE IN PUBLIC AREAS</h4>
    <p>The canine should be kept on a leash when in areas that allow access to the public. Exceptions to this rule would include specific law enforcement operations for which the canine is trained.</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>A canine shall not be left unattended in any area to which the public may have access.</li>
        <li>When the canine vehicle is left unattended all windows and doors shall be secured in such a manner as to prevent unauthorized access to the dog. The handler shall also ensure the unattended vehicle remains inhabitable for the canine.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>318.10 HANDLER COMPENSATION</h3>
    <p>The canine handler shall be available for call-out under conditions specified by the canine coordinator.</p>
    <p>The canine handler shall be compensated for time spent in the care, feeding, grooming and other needs of the canine in accordance with the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), and according to the terms of the memorandum of understanding (29 USC § 207).</p>

    <h3>318.11 CANINE INJURY AND MEDICAL CARE</h3>
    <p>In the event that a canine is injured or there is an indication that the canine is not in good physical condition the injury or condition will be reported to the canine coordinator or Shift Supervisor as soon as practicable and appropriately documented.</p>
    <p>All medical attention shall be rendered by the designated canine veterinarian, except during an emergency where treatment should be obtained from the nearest available veterinarian. All records of medical treatment shall be maintained in the handler’s personnel file.</p>

    <h3>318.12 TRAINING</h3>
    <p>Before assignment in the field each canine team shall be trained and certified to meet current nationally recognized standards or other recognized and approved certification standards. Cross- trained canine teams or those canine teams trained exclusively for the detection of narcotics and/ or explosives also shall be trained and certified to meet current nationally recognized standards or other recognized and approved certification standards established for their particular skills.</p>
    <p>The canine coordinator shall be responsible for scheduling periodic training for all departmentmembers in order to familiarize them with how to conduct themselves in the presence of department canines.</p>
    <p>All canine training should be conducted while on-duty unless otherwise approved by the canine coordinator or Shift Supervisor.</p>
    <h4>318.12.1 CONTINUED TRAINING</h4>
    <p>Each canine team shall thereafter be recertified to a current nationally recognized standard or other recognized and approved certification standards on an annual basis. Additional training considerations are as follows:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>If applicable, canine teams should receive training as defined in the current contract with the Metro Transit Police Department canine training provider.</li>
        <li>Canine handlers are encouraged to engage in additional training with approval of the canine coordinator.</li>
        <li>To ensure that all training is consistent no handler, trainer or outside vendor is authorized to train to a standard that is not reviewed and approved by this department.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>318.12.2 FAILURE TO SUCCESSFULLY COMPLETE TRAINING</h4>
    <p>Any canine team failing to graduate or obtain certification shall not be deployed in the field for tasks the team is not certified to perform until graduation or certification is achieved. When reasonably practicable pending successful certification the canine handler shall be temporarily reassigned to regular patrol duties.</p>
    <li><a name="bookmark315">TRAINING RECORDS</a></p>
    <p>All canine training records shall be maintained in the canine handler’s and the canine’s training file. These files shall be maintained by the handler and Canine Unit coordinator.</p>
    <h4>318.12.4 TRAINING AIDS</h4>
    <p>Training aids are required to effectively train and maintain the skills of canines. Officers possessing, using or transporting controlled substances or explosives for canine training purposes must comply with federal and state requirements regarding the same. Alternatively, the Metro Transit Police Department may work with outside trainers with the applicable licenses or permits.</p>
    <h4>318.12.5 CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE TRAINING AIDS</h4>
    <p>Officers acting in the performance of their official duties may possess or transfer controlled substances for the purpose of narcotics-detection canine training in compliance with federal laws and if they comply with applicable state requirements (21 USC § 823(f)).</p>
    <p>The Chief of Police or the authorized designee may authorize a member to seek a court order to allow controlled substances seized by the Metro Transit Police Department to be possessed by the member or a narcotics-detection canine trainer who is working under the direction of this department for training purposes provided the controlled substances are no longer needed as criminal evidence.</p>
    <p>As an alternative, the Chief of Police or the authorized designee may request narcotics training aids from another law enforcement agency.</p>
    <p>These procedures are not required if the canine handler uses commercially available synthetic substances that are not controlled narcotics.</p>
    <h4>318.12.6 CONTROLLED SUBSTANCE PROCEDURES</h4>
    <p>Due to the responsibilities and liabilities involved with possessing readily usable amounts of controlled substances and the ever-present danger of the canine’s accidental ingestion of these controlled substances, the following procedures shall be strictly followed:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>All controlled substance training samples shall be weighed and tested prior to dispensing to the individual canine handler or trainer.</li>
        <li>The weight and test results shall be recorded and maintained by the Canine Unit coordinator.</li>
        <li>Any person possessing controlled substance training samples pursuant to court order or DEA registration shall maintain custody and control of the controlled substances and shall keep records regarding any loss of, or damage to, those controlled substances.</li>
        <li>All controlled substance training samples will be inspected, weighed and tested quarterly. The results of the quarterly testing shall be recorded and maintained by the canine coordinator with a copy forwarded to the dispensing agency.</li>
        <li>All controlled substance training samples will be stored in locked, airtight and watertight cases at all times except during training. The locked cases shall be secured in the trunk of the canine handler’s assigned patrol vehicle during transport and stored in an appropriate locked container. There are no exceptions to this procedure.</li>
        <li>The canine coordinator shall periodically inspect every controlled substance training sample for damage or tampering and take any appropriate action.</li>
        <li>Any unusable controlled substance training samples shall be returned to the Property and Evidence or to the dispensing agency.</li>
        <li>All controlled substance training samples shall be returned to the dispensing agency upon the conclusion of the training or upon demand by the dispensing agency.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>318.12.7 EXPLOSIVE TRAINING AIDS</h4>
    <p>Officers may possess, transport, store or use explosives or destructive devices in compliance with state and federal laws (Minn. Stat. § 609.668, Subd. 3(a)(1)); 18 USC § 842; 27 CFR 555.41).</p>
    <p>Explosive training aids designed specifically for canine teams should be used whenever reasonably feasible. Due to the safety concerns in the handling and transportation of explosives, inert or non-hazardous training aids should be employed whenever feasible. The use of explosives or destructive devices for training aids by canine teams is subject to the following:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>All explosive training aids when not in use shall be properly stored in a secure facility appropriate for the type of materials.</li>
        <li>An inventory ledger shall be maintained to document the type and quantity of explosive training aids that are stored.</li>
        <li>The canine coordinator shall be responsible to verify the explosive training aids on hand against the inventory ledger once each quarter.</li>
        <li>Only members of the canine team shall have access to the explosive training aids storage facility.</li>
        <li>A primary and secondary custodian will be designated to minimize the possibility of loss of explosive training aids during and after the training. Generally the handler will be designated as the primary custodian while the trainer or authorized second person on-scene will be designated as the secondary custodian.</li>
        <li>Any lost or damaged explosive training aids shall be promptly reported to the canine coordinator who will determine if any further action will be necessary. Any loss of explosives will be reported to the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF).</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>320 - Domestic Abuse</h2>
    <h3>320.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this policy is to provide the guidelines necessary to deter, prevent and reduce domestic abuse through vigorous enforcement and to address domestic abuse as a serious crime against society. The policy specifically addresses the commitment of this department to take enforcement action when appropriate, to provide assistance to victims and to guide officers in the investigation of domestic abuse.</p>
    <h4>320.1.1 DEFINITIONS</h4>
    <p>Definitions related to this policy include:</p>
    <p><strong>Court order</strong> - All forms of orders related to domestic abuse, that have been issued by a court of this state or another, whether civil or criminal, regardless of whether service has been made.</p>
    <p><strong>Domestic abuse</strong> - Commission of any of the following if committed against a family or household member by another family or household member (Minn. Stat. § 518B.01 Subd. 2):</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Actual or fear of imminent physical harm, bodily injury, or assault</li>
        <li>Terroristic threats (Minn. Stat. § 609.713)</li>
        <li>Criminal sexual conduct (Minn. Stat. § 609.342 to Minn. Stat. § 609.3451)</li>
        <li>Interference with an emergency call (Minn. Stat. § 609.78)</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>320.2 POLICY</h3>
    <p>The Metro Transit Police Department's response to incidents of domestic abuse and violations of related court orders shall stress enforcement of the law to protect the victim and shall communicate the philosophy that domestic abuse is criminal behavior. It is also the policy of this department to facilitate victims' and offenders' access to appropriate civil remedies and community resources whenever feasible.</p>

    <h3>320.3 OFFICER SAFETY</h3>
    <p>The investigation of domestic abuse cases often places officers in emotionally charged and sometimes highly dangerous environments. No provision of this policy is intended to supersede the responsibility of all officers to exercise due caution and reasonable care in providing for the safety of any officers and parties involved.</p>

    <h3>INVESTIGATIONS</h3>
    <p>The following guidelines should be followed by officers when investigating domestic abuse cases:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Calls of reported, threatened, imminent or ongoing domestic abuse and the violation of any court order are of extreme importance and should be considered among the highest response priorities. This includes incomplete 9-1-1 calls.</li>
        <li>When practicable, officers should obtain and document statements from the victim, the suspect and any witnesses, including children, in or around the household or location of occurrence.</li>
        <li>Officers should list the full name and date of birth (and school if available) of each child who was present in the household at the time of the offense. The names of other children who may not have been in the house at that particular time should also be obtained for follow-up.</li>
        <li>When practicable and legally permitted, video or audio record all significant statements and observations.</li>
        <li>All injuries should be photographed, regardless of severity, taking care to preserve the victim's personal privacy. Where practicable, photographs should be taken by a person of the same sex. Victims whose injuries are not visible at the time of the incident should be asked to contact the Investigation Division in the event that the injuries later become visible.</li>
        <li>Officers should request that the victim complete and sign an authorization for release of medical records related to the incident when applicable.</li>
        <li>If the suspect is no longer at the scene, officers should make reasonable efforts to locate the suspect to further the investigation, provide the suspect with an opportunity to make a statement and make an arrest or seek an arrest warrant if appropriate.</li>
        <li>Seize any firearms or other dangerous weapons in the home, if appropriate and legally permitted, for safekeeping or as evidence.</li>
        <li>When completing an incident or arrest report for violation of a court order, officers should include specific information that establishes that the offender has been served, including the date the offender was served, the name of the agency that served the order and the provision of the order that the subject is alleged to have violated. When reasonably available, the arresting officer should attach a copy of the order to the incident or arrest report.</li>
        <li>Officers should take appropriate enforcement action when there is probable cause to believe an offense has occurred. Factors that should not be used as sole justification for declining to take enforcement action include:
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>Marital status of suspect and victim.</li>
                <li>Whether the suspect lives on the premises with the victim.</li>
                <li>Claims by the suspect that the victim provoked or perpetuated the violence.</li>
                <li>The potential financial or child custody consequences of arrest.</li>
                <li>The physical or emotional state of either party.</li>
                <li>Use of drugs or alcohol by either party.</li>
                <li>Denial that the abuse occurred where evidence indicates otherwise.</li>
                <li>A request by the victim not to arrest the suspect.</li>
                <li>Location of the incident (public/private).</li>
                <li>Speculation that the complainant may not follow through with the prosecution.</li>
                <li>The racial, cultural, social, professional position or sexual orientation of the victim or suspect.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>320.4.1 IF A SUSPECT IS ARRESTED</h4>
    <p>If a suspect is arrested, officers should:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Advise the victim that there is no guarantee the suspect will remain in custody.</li>
        <li>Provide the victim’s contact information to the jail staff to enable notification of the victim upon the suspect’s release from jail (Minn. Stat. § 629.72 Subd. 6).</li>
        <li>Advise the victim whether any type of court order will be in effect when the suspect is released from jail.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>320.4.2 IF NO ARREST IS MADE</h4>
    <p>If no arrest is made, the officer should:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Advise the parties of any options, including but not limited to:
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>Voluntary separation of the parties.</li>
                <li>Appropriate resource referrals (e.g., counselors, friends, relatives, shelter homes, victim witness unit).</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Document the resolution in a report.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>320.5 VICTIM ASSISTANCE</h3>
    <p>Victims may be traumatized or confused. Officers should:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Recognize that a victim's behavior and actions may be affected.</li>
        <li>Provide the victim with the department's domestic abuse information handout, even if the incident may not rise to the level of a crime.</li>
        <li>Alert the victim to any available victim advocates, shelters and community resources.</li>
        <li>Stand by for a reasonable amount of time when an involved person requests law enforcement assistance while removing essential items of personal property.</li>
        <li>Seek medical assistance as soon as practicable for the victim if he/she has sustained injury or complains of pain.</li>
        <li>Ask the victim whether he/she has a safe place to stay. Assist in arranging to transport the victim to an alternate shelter if the victim expresses a concern for his/her safety or if the officer determines that a need exists.</li>
        <li>Make reasonable efforts to ensure that children or dependent adults who are under the supervision of the suspect or victim are being properly cared for.</li>
        <li>Seek or assist the victim in obtaining an emergency order if appropriate.</li>
    </ol>

    <h4>320.6 DISPATCH ASSISTANCE</h4>
    <p>All calls of domestic abuse, including incomplete 9-1-1 calls, should be dispatched as soon as practicable.</p>
    <p>Dispatchers are not required to verify the validity of a court order before responding to a request for assistance. Officers should request that dispatchers check whether any of the involved persons are subject to the terms of a court order.</p>

    <h3>320.7 FOREIGN COURT ORDERS</h3>
    <p>Various types of orders may be issued in domestic abuse cases. Any foreign court order properly issued by a court of another state, Indian tribe or territory shall be enforced by officers as if it were the order of a court in this state. An order should be considered properly issued when it reasonably appears that the issuing court has jurisdiction over the parties and reasonable notice and opportunity to respond was given to the party against whom the order was issued (18 USC</p>
    <p>§ 2265). An otherwise valid out-of-state court order shall be enforced, regardless of whether the order has been properly registered with this state.</p>

    <h3>320.8 VERIFICATION OF COURT ORDERS</h3>
    <p>Determining the validity of a court order, particularly an order from another jurisdiction, can be challenging. Therefore, in determining whether there is probable cause to make an arrest for a violation of any court order, officers should carefully review the actual order when available, and, where appropriate and practicable:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Ask the subject of the order about his/her notice or receipt of the order, his/her knowledge of its terms and efforts to respond to the order.</li>
        <li>Check available records or databases that may show the status or conditions of the order.</li>
        <li>Contact the issuing court to verify the validity of the order.</li>
        <li>Contact a law enforcement official from the jurisdiction where the order was issued to verify information.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Officers should document in an appropriate report their efforts to verify the validity of an order, regardless of whether an arrest is made. Officers should contact a supervisor for clarification when needed.</p>

    <h3>320.9 LEGAL MANDATES AND RELEVANT LAWS</h3>
    <p>Minnesota law provides for the following:</p>
    <h4>320.9.1 STANDARDS FOR ARRESTS</h4>
    <p>Officers investigating a domestic abuse report should consider the following:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>An officer has the authority to arrest a person without a warrant, including at the person’s residence, if the peace officer has probable cause to believe that the person has, within the preceding 72 hours, exclusive of the day probable cause was established, assaulted, threatened with a dangerous weapon or placed in fear of immediate bodily harm any person covered by the “family or household member” definition, even if the assault did not rise to the level of a felony or did not take place in the presence of the peace officer (Minn. Stat. § 629.34; Minn. Stat. § 629.341).</li>
        <li>Officers should generally not make dual arrests but may make an arrest of a primary aggressor. Where there are allegations that each party assaulted the other, the officer shall determine whether there is sufficient evidence to conclude that one of the parties was the primary aggressor based on the following criteria and the officer’s judgment (Minn. Stat. § 629.342, Subd. 2):
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>Comparative extent of any injuries inflicted</li>
                <li>Fear of physical injury because of past or present threats</li>
                <li>Actions taken in self-defense or to protect oneself</li>
                <li>History of domestic abuse perpetrated by one party against the other</li>
                <li>Existence or previous existence of an order for protection</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>An officer shall not issue a citation in lieu of arrest and detention to an individual charged with any of the following offenses (Minn. Stat. § 629.72):
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>Stalking</li>
                <li>Domestic abuse</li>
                <li>Violation of an order for protection</li>
                <li>Violation of a domestic abuse no contact order</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>The Shift Supervisor will determine whether a person arrested on a charge of stalking any person, domestic abuse, violation of an order for protection, violation of a domestic abuse no contact order or violation of a court-ordered transfer of firearms will be held in custody or be issued a citation in lieu of continued detention and released after booking. The person shall be held in custody whenever the Shift Supervisor determines that it reasonably appears the release of the person (Minn. Stat. § 629.72):
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>Poses a threat to the alleged victim or another family or household member.</li>
                <li>Poses a threat to public safety.</li>
                <li>Involves a substantial likelihood that the arrested person will fail to appear at subsequent proceedings.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Officers shall arrest and take into custody, without a warrant, a person whom the peace officer has probable cause to believe has violated a court order issued pursuant to Minn.<br/><br/>
        Stat. § 518B.01 or Minn. Stat. § 629.75. Such an arrest shall be made even if the violation of the order did not take place in the presence of the peace officer, if the officer can verify the existence of the order. If the person is not released on citation in lieu of continuing detention, the person shall be held in custody for these violations for at least 36 hours unless released by a court (Minn. Stat. § 518B.01; Minn. Stat. § 629.75).</li>
        <li>An arrest for a violation of an order of protection may be made regardless of whether the excluded party was invited back to the residence (Minn. Stat. § 518B.01, Subd. 18).</li>
        <li>Following an arrest, an officer should contact the local domestic abuse program by phone as soon as possible and provide the name and address of the victim and a brief factual account of events associated with the action.</li>
        <li>An officer shall arrest and take into custody a person whom the officer has probable cause to believe has violated a harassment restraining order, pursuant to Minn. Stat. § 609.748,  if the ﻿officer﻿ can verify the existence of the order.</li>
        <li>Officers are authorized to make an arrest without a warrant when there is probable cause to believe the person has violated the provisions of any other no contact or restraining order issued by a court, even if the offense did not rise to the level of a felony (Minn. Stat. § 629.34). While conducting a domestic abuse investigation officers shall attempt to verify whether there has been a court order issued.</li>
        <li>Officers should consider whether other offenses have been committed that may not qualify as a domestic abuse including, but not limited to, burglary, felony assault, terroristic threats, kidnapping, false imprisonment, witness tampering, trespassing, criminal damage to property, disorderly conduct or assault.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>320.9.2 REPORTS AND RECORDS</h4>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Officers should include information related to the following in a report, as applicable (Minn. Stat. § 629.341):
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>Names, addresses, telephone numbers of all involved persons</li>
                <li>Condition of clothing</li>

            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Domestic abuse reports should be forwarded to the appropriate prosecutor for review and consideration of criminal charges, even when no arrest is made or warrant requested.</li>
        <li>If a child was present at the scene of a domestic abuse incident or was the victim of domestic abuse, the officer should determine whether the child has been subjected to physical abuse, sexual abuse or neglect, and comply with the mandatory reporting requirements of Minn. Stat. § 626.556.</p>
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>The officer shall also attempt to verify whether there has been an order for protection issued under Minn. Stat. § 260C.201 and take appropriate action.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Fees will not be charged for the release of reports related to domestic abuse, as directed in Minn. Stat. § 13.82.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>320.9.3 SERVICE OF COURT ORDERS</h3>
    <p>Officers, when reasonably safe and in a position to do so, shall serve copies or short forms of court orders as directed in Minn. Stat. § 518B.01 and Minn. Stat. § 609.748.</p>
    <h4>320.9.4 COURT-ORDERED FIREARM SURRENDERS</h4>
    <p>Although not required, this department generally will accept firearms surrendered by a court order from an abusing party or defendant. A decision to refuse a surrendered firearm should be approved by a supervisor.</p>
    <p>Firearms will normally be surrendered at the Metro Transit Police Department; however, when encountering someone in the field who wishes to surrender a firearm, officers should make reasonable efforts to accommodate the request.</p>
    <p>Surrendered firearms should be collected and submitted to the ﻿Property and Evidence﻿ in accordance with the ﻿Property and Evidence﻿ Policy.</p>
</div>

            <div class="chapter" id="322">
    <h2>322 - Search and Seizure</h2>
    <h3>322.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>Both the federal and state Constitutions provide every individual with the right to be free from unreasonable searches and seizures. This policy provides general guidelines for Metro Transit Police Department personnel to consider when dealing with
        search and seizure issues.</p>

    <h3>322.2 POLICY</h3>
    <p>It is the policy of the Metro Transit Police Department to respect the fundamental privacy rights of individuals. Members of this department will conduct searches in strict observance of the constitutional rights of persons being searched. All seizures
        by this department will comply with relevant federal and state law governing the seizure of persons and property.</p>
    <p>The Department will provide relevant and current training to officers as guidance for the application of current law, local community standards and prosecutorial considerations regarding specific search and seizure situations, as appropriate.</p>

    <h3>322.3 SEARCHES</h3>
    <p>The U.S. Constitution generally provides that a valid warrant is required in order for a search to be valid. There are, however, several exceptions that permit a warrantless search.</p>
    <p>Examples of law enforcement activities that are exceptions to the general warrant requirement include, but are not limited to, searches pursuant to the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Valid consent</li>
        <li>Incident to a lawful arrest</li>
        <li>Legitimate community caretaking interests</li>
        <li>Vehicle searches under certain circumstances</li>
        <li>Exigent circumstances</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Certain other activities are recognized by federal and state courts and by certain statutes as legitimate law enforcement activities that also do not require a warrant. Such activities may include seizure and examination of abandoned property, and
        observations of activities and property located on open public areas.</p>
    <p>Because case law regarding search and seizure is constantly changing and subject to interpretation by the courts, each member of this department is expected to act in each situation according to current training and his/her familiarity with clearly
        established rights as determined by case law.</p>
    <p>Whenever practicable, officers are encouraged to contact a supervisor to resolve questions regarding search and seizure issues prior to electing a course of action.</p>

    <h3>322.4 SEARCH PROTOCOL</h3>
    <p>Although conditions will vary and officer safety and other exigencies must be considered in every search situation, the following guidelines should be followed whenever circumstances reasonably permit:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Members of this department will strive to conduct searches with dignity and courtesy.</li>
        <li>Officers should explain to the person being searched the reason for the search and how the search will be conducted.</li>
        <li>Searches should be carried out with due regard and respect for private property interests and in a manner that minimizes damage. Property should be left in a condition as close as reasonably possible to its pre-search condition.</li>
        <li>In order to minimize the need for forcible entry, an attempt should be made to obtain keys, combinations or access codes when a search of locked property is anticipated.</li>
        <li>When the person to be searched is of the opposite sex as the searching officer, a reasonable effort should be made to summon an officer of the same sex as the subject to conduct the search. When it is not practicable to summon an officer of the
            same sex as the subject, the following guidelines should be followed:</p>
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>Another officer or a supervisor should witness the search.</li>
                <li>The officer should not search areas of the body covered by tight-fitting clothing, sheer clothing or clothing that could not reasonably conceal a weapon.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>322.5 DOCUMENTATION</h3>
    <p>Officers are responsible to document any search and to ensure that any required reports are sufficient including, at minimum, documentation of the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Reason for the search</li>
        <li>Any efforts used to minimize the intrusiveness of any search (e.g., asking for consent or keys)</li>
        <li>What, if any, injuries or damage occurred</li>
        <li>All steps taken to secure property</li>
        <li>The results of the search, including a description of any property or contraband seized</li>
        <li>If the person searched is the opposite sex, any efforts to summon an officer of the same sex as the person being searched and the identification of any witness officer</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Supervisors shall review reports to ensure the reports are accurate, that actions are properly documented and that current legal requirements and department policy have been met.</p>

    <h2>324 - Temporary Custody of Juveniles</h2>
    <h3>324.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>This policy provides guidelines consistent with the Juvenile Justice and Delinquency Prevention Act for juveniles taken into temporary custody by members of the Metro Transit Police Department (42 USC § 5633; Minn. Stat. § 260B.176; Minn. Stat. §
        260C.176).</p>
    <p>This policy does not apply to secure detention facilities, shelter care facilities or the juvenile portion of an adult facility authorized to hold juveniles, but rather applies to the temporary custody of a juvenile before a juvenile is released,
        delivered to a court or delivered to any of these other facilities (Minn. Stat. § 260B.176 Subd. 3).</p>
    <h4>324.1.1 DEFINITIONS</h4>
    <p>Definitions related to this policy include:</p>
    <p><strong>Custodian or Guardian</strong> - A person who is under a legal obligation or who is in fact providing care and support for a minor (Minn. Stat. § 260B.007 Subd. 13; Minn. Stat. § 260C.007 Subd. 13).</p>
    <p><strong>Juvenile non-offender</strong> - An abused, neglected, dependent or alien juvenile who may be legally held for his/her own safety or welfare. This includes those held as runaways (Minn. Stat. § 260C.175), truancy violators (Minn. Stat. § 260C.143)
        and juveniles 15 years old or younger in custody related to their engaging in prostitution or related activities (Minn. Stat. § 260B.007 Subd. 6(c)). This also includes any juvenile who may have initially been contacted for an offense that would
        not subject an adult to arrest (e.g., fine-only offense) but was taken into custody for his/her protection or for purposes of reuniting the juvenile with a parent, guardian or other responsible person.</p>
    <p><strong>Juvenile offender</strong> - A juvenile 17 years of age or younger who is alleged to have committed an offense that would subject an adult to arrest (a non-status offense). It also includes possession of a handgun in violation of Minn. Stat.
        § 624.713 (28 CFR 31.303). This does not include a juvenile petty offender under Minn. Stat. § 260B.007.</p>
    <p><strong>Non-secure custody</strong> - When a juvenile is held in the presence of an officer or other custody employee at all times and is not placed in a locked room, cell or behind any locked doors. Juveniles in non-secure custody may be handcuffed
        but not to a stationary or secure object. Personal supervision through direct visual monitoring and audio two-way communication is maintained. Monitoring through electronic devices such as video does not replace direct visual observation.</p>
    <p><strong>Secure custody</strong> - When a juvenile offender is held in a locked room, a set of rooms or a cell. Secure custody also includes being physically secured to a stationary object.</p>
    <p>Examples of secure custody include:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>A juvenile left alone in an unlocked room within the secure perimeter of the adult temporary holding area.</li>
        <li>A juvenile handcuffed to a rail.</li>
        <li>A juvenile placed in a room that contains doors with delayed egress devices that have a delay of more than 30 seconds.</li>
        <li>A juvenile being processed in a secure booking area when an unsecure booking area is available.</li>
        <li>A juvenile left alone in a secure booking area after being photographed and fingerprinted.</li>
        <li>A juvenile placed in a cell within the adult temporary holding area whether or not the cell door is locked.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Sight and sound separation</strong> - Located or arranged to prevent physical, visual or auditory contact.</p>
    <p><strong>Status offender</strong> - A juvenile suspected of committing a criminal violation of the law that would not be a criminal violation but for the age of the offender. Examples may include underage possession of tobacco or curfew violation.
        A juvenile in custody on a court order or warrant based upon a status offense is also a status offender. Juvenile petty offenders taken into custody should be considered a status offender for purposes of this policy (Minn. Stat. § 260B.007; Minn.
        Stat. § 260B.143).</p>

    <h3>324.2 POLICY</h3>
    <p>The Metro Transit Police Department is committed to releasing juveniles from temporary custody as soon as reasonably practicable and keeping juveniles safe while they are in temporary custody at the Metro Transit Police Department. Juveniles should
        be held in temporary custody only for as long as reasonably necessary for processing, transfer or release.</p>

    <h3>324.3 JUVENILES WHO SHOULD NOT BE HELD</h3>
    <p>Juveniles who exhibit any of the following conditions should not be held at the Metro Transit Police Department:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Unconscious</li>
        <li>Seriously injured</li>
        <li>A known suicide risk or obviously severely emotionally disturbed</li>
        <li>Significantly intoxicated</li>
        <li>Extremely violent or continuously violent</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Officers taking custody of a juvenile who exhibits any of the above conditions should take reasonable steps to provide medical attention or mental health assistance and notify a supervisor of the situation.</p>
    <p>These juveniles should not be held at the Metro Transit Police Department unless they have been evaluated by a qualified medical and/or mental health professional.</p>
    <p>If the officer taking custody of the juvenile believes the juvenile may be a suicide risk, the juvenile shall be under continuous direct supervision until evaluation, release or a transfer is completed.</p>
    <h4>324.3.1 SUICIDE PREVENTION OF JUVENILES IN CUSTODY</h4>
    <p>The arresting officer should be alert to potential symptoms based upon exhibited behavior that may indicate the juvenile is a suicide risk. These symptoms may include depression, refusal to communicate, verbally threatening to kill him/herself or
        any unusual behavior that may indicate the juvenile may harm him/herself while in custody.</p>

    <h3>CUSTODY OF JUVENILES</h3>
    <p>Officers should take custody of a juvenile and temporarily hold the juvenile at the Metro Transit Police Department when there is no other lawful and practicable alternative to temporary custody. Refer to the Child Abuse Policy for additional information
        regarding detaining a juvenile that is suspected of being a victim.</p>
    <p>No juvenile should be held in temporary custody at the Metro Transit Police Department without authorization of the arresting officer's supervisor or the Shift Supervisor.</p>
    <p>Any juvenile taken into custody shall be released to the care of the juvenile’s parent or other responsible adult or transferred to a juvenile custody facility or to other authority as soon as practicable and in no event shall a juvenile be held beyond
        six hours from the time of his/her entry into the Metro Transit Police Department (42 USC § 5633).</p>
    <h4>324.4.1 CUSTODY OF JUVENILE NON-OFFENDERS</h4>
    <p>Non-offenders taken into protective custody in compliance with the Child Abuse Policy should generally not be held at the Metro Transit Police Department. Custodial arrangements should be made for non-offenders as soon as reasonably possible (Minn.
        Stat. § 260B.175; Minn. Stat. § 260C.143; Minn. Stat. § 260C.176). Juvenile non-offenders may not be held in secure custody (42 USC § 5633).</p>
    <p>Juveniles detained for truancy violations may be released to a truancy service center, released to the superintendent or teacher at their school of enrollment, or released to a parent or legal guardian (Minn. Stat. § 260C.143; Minn. Stat. § 260A.04
        Subd. 3).</p>
    <h4>324.4.2 CUSTODY OF JUVENILE STATUS OFFENDERS</h4>
    <p>Status offenders should generally be released by citation or with a warning rather than taken into temporary custody. However officers may take custody of a status offender if requested to do so by a parent or legal guardian in order to facilitate
        reunification (e.g., transported home or to the station to await a parent). Juvenile status offenders may not be held in secure custody (42 USC § 5633).</p>
    <h3>324.4.3 CUSTODY OF JUVENILE OFFENDERS</h4>
							                                <p>Juvenile offenders should be held in non-secure custody while at the Metro Transit Police Department unless another form of custody is authorized by this policy or is necessary due to exigent circumstances.</p>
							                                <p>Generally juvenile offenders may be taken into custody under the authority of Minn. Stat. § 260B.175 when a court order authorizes the custody, when the juvenile has committed an offense that would warrant the arrest of an adult or it is reasonably believed that the child has violated the terms of probation, parole or other field supervision.</p>
							                                <p>An officer who takes a juvenile offender of any age or gender into custody or could take the juvenile into custody under Minn. Stat. § 260B.175 is authorized to perform a protective pat-down search of the juvenile offender in order to protect the officer’s safety (Minn. Stat. § 260B.175 Subd. 4).</p>
							                                <p>The parent, guardian or custodian of the juvenile shall be notified as soon as possible when a juvenile offender is taken into custody. Juvenile offenders shall be released to the custody of a parent, guardian, custodian or other suitable person unless there is reason to believe that the juvenile would (Minn. Stat. § 260B.176):</p>
							                                <ol class="alpha">
							                                    <li>Endanger him/herself or others.</li>
							                                    <li>Not return for a court hearing.</li>
							                                    <li>Run away from or otherwise not remain in the care or control of his/her parent, guardian or custodian.</li>
							                                    <li>Face immediate endangerment to his/her health or welfare.</li>
							                                </ol>
							                                <p>If a juvenile offender is not released to a parent, guardian, custodian or other suitable person, the officer taking the juvenile offender into custody shall notify the court as soon as possible of the detention of the juvenile and the reasons for detention (Minn. Stat. § 260B.176).</p>
							                                <h4>324.4.4 SCHOOL NOTIFICATION</h4>
							                                <p>Minnesota law requires that the Chief of Police or the authorized designee notify the superintendent or chief administrative officer of a juvenile’s school of an incident occurring within our jurisdiction if (Minn. Stat. § 260B.171 Subd. 5):</p>
							                                <ol class="alpha">
							                                    <li>There is probable cause to believe a juvenile has committed an offense that would be a crime if committed as an adult, where the victim is a student or staff member and the notice is reasonably necessary for the protection of the victim.</li>
							                                    <li>There is probable cause to believe a juvenile has committed certain serious crimes regardless of whether the victim is a student or staff member.</li>
							                                    <li>The juvenile is taken into protective custody and methamphetamine manufacture or storage is involved (see the Child Abuse Policy for guidelines) (see also, Minn. Stat. § 260C.171)</li>
							                                </ol>
							                                <p>However the department is not required to notify the school if it is determined that notice would jeopardize an ongoing investigation.</p>

							                                <h3>324.5 ADVISEMENTS</h3>
    <p>When a juvenile is taken into custody on a warrant the juvenile and his/her parent, guardian or custodian, if present, shall immediately be informed of the existence of the warrant for immediate custody and, as soon as practicable, of the reasons
        why the juvenile is being taken into custody (Minnesota Rules of Juvenile Delinquency Procedure 4.03, Subd. 10).</p>
    <p>If it is determined that a juvenile taken into custody is going to be placed into a secure detention facility or a shelter care facility, the officer shall advise both the juvenile and the juvenile’s parent, guardian or custodian as soon as possible
        (Minn. Stat. § 260B.176 Subd. 3; Minn. Stat. § 260C.176 Subd. 3):</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Of the reasons for custody and the reasons for placement.</li>
        <li>Of the location of the facility unless there is reason to believe that disclosure would place the juvenile’s health and welfare in immediate endangerment. If so, the disclosure shall not be made (Minn. Stat. § 260B.176 Subd. 5).</li>
        <li>That the juvenile’s parent, guardian or custodian and attorney or guardian ad litem may make an initial visit to the facility at any time. Subsequent visits may also be made on a reasonable basis.</li>
        <li>That the juvenile may telephone parents and an attorney or guardian ad litem immediately after being admitted to the facility and thereafter on a reasonable basis.</li>
        <li>That the juvenile may not be detained for acts under Minn. Stat. § 260B.007 Subd. 6 for longer than 36 hours excluding weekends and holidays unless a petition has been filed pursuant to Minn. Stat. § 260B.178.</li>
        <li>That the juvenile may not be detained under Minn. Stat. § 260C.175 Subd. 1, clause (1) or (2), item (ii) longer than 72 hours at a shelter care facility excluding weekends and holidays unless a petition has been filed pursuant to Minn. Stat. §
            260C.178.</li>
        <li>That the juvenile may not be detained for acts under Minn. Stat. § 260B.007 Subd. 6 for longer than 24 hours in an adult jail or municipal lockup excluding weekends and holidays or longer than six hours if the adult jail or municipal lockup is
            a standard metropolitan statistical area, unless a petition has been filed pursuant to Minn. Stat. § 260B.178 and a motion made to refer the juvenile for adult prosecution.</li>
        <li>Of the date, time and place of the detention hearing, if this information is available.</li>
        <li>That the juvenile and the juvenile’s parent, guardian or custodian have the right to be present and to be represented by counsel at the detention hearing and that if they cannot afford counsel it will be appointed at public expense.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>324.6 JUVENILE CUSTODY LOGS</h3>
    <p>Any time a juvenile is held in custody at the Department the custody shall be promptly and properly documented in the juvenile custody log, including:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Identifying information about the juvenile being held.</li>
        <li>Date and time of arrival and release from the Metro Transit Police Department.</li>
        <li>Shift Supervisor notification and approval to temporarily hold the juvenile.</li>
        <li>Any charges for which the juvenile is being held and classification of the juvenile as a juvenile offender, status offender or non-offender.</li>

        <li>Time of all welfare checks.</li>
        <li>Any medical and other screening requested and completed.</li>
        <li>Circumstances that justify any secure custody.</li>
        <li>Any other information that may be required by other authorities, such as compliance inspectors or a local juvenile court authority.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The Shift Supervisor shall initial the log to approve the custody including any secure custody and shall also initial the log when the juvenile is released.</p>

    <h3>324.7 NO-CONTACT REQUIREMENTS</h3>
    <p>Sight and sound separation shall be maintained between all juveniles and adults while in custody at the Department (42 USC § 5633). There should also be sight and sound separation between non-offenders and juvenile or status offenders.</p>
    <p>In situations where brief or accidental contact may occur (e.g., during the brief time a juvenile is being fingerprinted and/or photographed in booking) a member of the Metro Transit Police Department shall maintain a constant, immediate presence
        with the juvenile or the adult to minimize any contact. If inadvertent or accidental contact does occur, reasonable efforts shall be taken to end the contact.</p>

    <h3>324.8 TEMPORARY CUSTODY REQUIREMENTS</h3>
    <p>Members and supervisors assigned to monitor or process any juvenile at the Metro Transit Police Department shall ensure the following:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>The Shift Supervisor should be notified if it is anticipated that a juvenile may need to remain at the Metro Transit Police Department more than four hours. This will enable the Shift Supervisor to ensure no juvenile is held at the Metro Transit
            Police Department more than six hours.</li>
        <li>A staff member of the same sex shall supervise personal hygiene activities and care such as changing clothing or using the restroom without direct observation to allow for privacy.</li>
        <li>Personal visual checks and significant incidents/activities shall be noted on the log.</li>
        <li>There shall be no viewing devices such as peep holes or mirrors of which the juvenile is not aware. Therefore an employee should inform a juvenile under his/her care that the juvenile will be monitored at all times unless he/she is using the toilet.
            This does not apply to surreptitious and legally obtained recorded interrogations.</li>
        <li>Juveniles shall have reasonable access to toilets and wash basins.</li>
        <li>Food should be provided if a juvenile has not eaten within the past four hours or is otherwise in need of nourishment including any special diet required for the health of the juvenile.</li>
        <li>Juveniles shall have reasonable access to a drinking fountain or water.</li>
        <li>Juveniles shall have reasonable opportunities to stand and stretch, particularly if handcuffed or restrained in any way.</li>
        <li>Juveniles should have privacy during family, guardian and/or lawyer visits.</li>
        <li>Juveniles should be permitted to remain in their personal clothing unless the clothing is taken as evidence or is otherwise unsuitable or inadequate for continued wear while in custody.</li>
        <li>Blankets should be provided as reasonably necessary.</li>
        <li>Adequate shelter, heat, light and ventilation should be provided without compromising security or enabling escape.</li>
        <li>Juveniles shall have adequate furnishings including suitable chairs or benches.</li>
        <li>Juveniles shall have the right to the same number of telephone calls as an adult in custody.</li>
        <li>No discipline may be administered to any juvenile nor may juveniles be subjected to corporal or unusual punishment, humiliation or mental abuse.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>324.9 USE OF RESTRAINT DEVICES</h3>
    <p>Juvenile offenders may be handcuffed in accordance with the Handcuffing and Restraints Policy. A juvenile offender may be handcuffed at the Metro Transit Police Department when the juvenile presents a heightened risk. However non-offenders and status
        offenders should not be handcuffed unless they are combative or threatening.</p>
    <p>Restraints shall only be used after less restrictive measures have failed and with the approval of the Shift Supervisor. Restraints shall only be used so long as it reasonably appears necessary for the juvenile's protection or the protection of others.</p>
    <p>Juveniles in restraints shall be kept away from other unrestrained juveniles or monitored in such a way as to protect the juvenile from abuse.</p>

    <h3>324.10 PERSONAL PROPERTY</h3>
    <p>The officer taking custody of a juvenile offender or status offender at the Metro Transit Police Department shall ensure a thorough search of the juvenile’s property is made and all property is removed from the juvenile especially those items that
        could compromise safety, such as pens, pencils and belts.</p>
    <p>The personal property of a juvenile should be placed in a property bag. The property should be inventoried in the juvenile’s presence and sealed into the bag. The property should be kept in a monitored or secure location until the juvenile is released
        from the custody of the Metro Transit Police Department.</p>

    <h3>324.11 SECURE CUSTODY</h3>
    <p>Only juvenile offenders 14 years of age or older may be placed in secure custody. Shift Supervisor approval is required before placing a juvenile offender in secure custody.</p>
    <p>Secure custody should only be used for juvenile offenders when there is a reasonable belief that the juvenile is a serious risk of harm to him/herself or others.</p>
    <p>Members of this department should not use secure custody for convenience when non-secure custody is or later becomes a reasonable option.</p>
    <p>When reasonably practicable handcuffing one hand of a juvenile offender to a fixed object while otherwise maintaining the juvenile in non-secure custody should be considered as the method of secure custody rather than the use of a locked enclosure.
        An employee must be present at all times to ensure the juvenile's safety while secured to a stationary object.</p>
    <p>Generally juveniles should not be secured to a stationary object for more than 60 minutes. Supervisor approval is required to secure a juvenile to a stationary object for longer than 60 minutes and every 30 minutes thereafter. Supervisor approval
        should be documented.</p>
    <h4>324.11.1 LOCKED ENCLOSURES</h4>
    <p>A thorough inspection of the area shall be conducted before placing a juvenile into the enclosure. A second inspection shall be conducted after removing the juvenile. Any damage noted to the room should be photographed and documented in the crime
        report.</p>
    <p>The following requirements shall apply to a juvenile offender who is held inside a locked enclosure:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>The juvenile shall constantly be monitored by an audio/video system during the entire custody.</li>
        <li>Juveniles shall have constant auditory access to department members.</li>
        <li>Initial placement into and removal from a locked enclosure shall be logged.</li>
        <li>Random personal visual checks of the juvenile by a staff member no less than every 15 minutes shall occur.
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>All checks shall be logged.</li>
                <li>The check should involve questioning the juvenile as to his/her well-being (sleeping juveniles or apparently sleeping juveniles should be awakened).</li>
                <li>Requests or concerns of the juvenile should be logged.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Males and females shall not be placed in the same locked room.</li>
        <li>Juvenile offenders should be separated according to severity of the crime (e.g., felony or misdemeanor).</li>
        <li>Restrained juveniles shall not be mixed in a cell or room with unrestrained juveniles.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>324.12 SUICIDE ATTEMPT, DEATH OR SERIOUS INJURY OF A JUVENILE</h3>
    <p>The Shift Supervisor will ensure procedures are in place to address the suicide attempt, death or serious injury of any juvenile held at the Metro Transit Police Department. The procedures will address:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Immediate notification of the on-duty supervisor, Chief of Police and Criminal Investigations Division Supervisor.</li>
        <li>Notification of the parent, guardian or person standing in loco parentis, of the juvenile.</li>
        <li>Notification of the appropriate prosecutor.</li>
        <li>Notification of the local prosecuting attorney.</li>
        <li>Evidence preservation.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>324.13 INTERVIEWING OR INTERROGATING JUVENILE SUSPECTS</h3>
    <p>No interview or interrogation of a juvenile should occur unless the juvenile has the apparent capacity to consent and does consent to an interview or interrogation.</p>

    <h2>326 - Adult Abuse</h2>
    <h3>326.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this policy is to provide guidelines for the investigation and reporting of suspected abuse of certain adults who may be more vulnerable than others. This policy also addresses mandatory notification for Metro Transit Police Department
        members as required by law.</p>
    <h4>326.1.1 DEFINITIONS</h4>
    <p>Definitions related to this policy include:</p>
    <p><strong>Adult abuse</strong> - Any offense or attempted offense involving violence or neglect of an adult victim when committed by a person responsible for the adult’s care, or any other act that would mandate reporting or notification to a social
        service agency or law enforcement.</p>

    <h3>326.2 POLICY</h3>
    <p>The Metro Transit Police Department will investigate all reported incidents of alleged adult abuse and ensure proper reporting and notification as required by law.</p>

    <h3>326.3 MANDATORY NOTIFICATION</h3>
    <p>Members of the Metro Transit Police Department shall notify the entity responsible for receiving such reports when they have reason to believe that a vulnerable adult is being or has been maltreated, or has sustained a physical injury which is not
        reasonably explained. Members shall also report suspected negligent care by a service or health care provider that resulted in injury or harm requiring the care of a physician (Minn. Stat. § 626.557).</p>
    <p>For purposes of notification, a vulnerable adult is a person age 18 or older who has physical, mental or emotional disabilities that make it difficult for the person to care for or to protect him/ herself from maltreatment. It also refers to adults
        who reside at a facility, or receive care at a facility or through home care (Minn. Stat. § 626.5572).</p>
    <p>Maltreatment includes abuse, neglect and financial exploitation. Abuse can be physical, emotional or sexual. Financial exploitation may include any instance where vulnerable adults’ money, assets or property are not used for their benefit or are stolen
        or kept from them (see Minn. Stat. § 626.5572 for full definitions).</p>
    <h4>326.3.1 NOTIFICATION PROCEDURE</h4>
    <p>Oral notification should be made as soon as possible, but in all cases within 24 hours (Minn. Stat.</p>
    <p>§ 626.557; Minn. Stat. § 626.5572). To the extent possible, the following should be included in the notification:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>The identity the vulnerable adult and any caregiver</li>
        <li>The nature and extent of the suspected maltreatment</li>
        <li>Any evidence of previous maltreatment</li>
        <li>The name and addresses of the person initiating the report or other witnesses</li>
        <li>The time, date, and location of the incident</li>
        <li>Any other information that might be helpful in investigating the suspected maltreatment</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If notification of maltreatment is first made to the Metro Transit Police Department, the member receiving the notification shall complete and forward the intake form to the entity responsible for receiving such reports.</p>

    <h3>326.4 QUALIFIED INVESTIGATORS</h3>
    <p>Qualified investigators should be available to investigate cases of adult abuse. These investigators should:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Conduct interviews in appropriate interview facilities.</li>
        <li>Be familiar with forensic interview techniques specific to adult abuse investigations.</li>
        <li>Present all cases of alleged adult abuse to the prosecutor for review.</li>
        <li>Coordinate with other enforcement agencies, social service agencies and facility administrators as needed.</li>
        <li>Provide referrals to therapy services, victim advocates, guardians and support for the victim and family as appropriate.</li>
        <li>Participate in or coordinate with multidisciplinary investigative teams as applicable (Minn. Stat. § 626.5571).</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>326.5 INVESTIGATIONS AND REPORTING</h3>
    <p>All reported or suspected cases of adult abuse require investigation and a report, even if the allegations appear unfounded or unsubstantiated. Investigations should be initiated a soon as possible, but in all cases within 24 hours (Minn. Stat. §
        626.557).
    </p>
    <p>Investigations and reports related to suspected cases of adult abuse should address, as applicable:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>The overall basis for the contact. This should be done by the investigating officer in all circumstances where a suspected adult abuse victim is contacted.</li>
        <li>Any relevant statements the victim may have made and to whom he/she made the statements.</li>
        <li>If a person is taken into protective custody, the reasons, the name and title of the person making the decision, and why other alternatives were not appropriate.</li>
        <li>Documentation of any visible injuries or any injuries identified by the victim. This should include photographs of such injuries, if practicable.</li>
        <li>Whether the victim was transported for medical treatment or a medical examination.</li>
        <li>Whether the victim identified a household member as the alleged perpetrator, and a list of the names of any other potential victims or witnesses who may reside in the residence.</li>
        <li>Identification of any prior related reports or allegations of abuse, including other jurisdictions, as reasonably known.</li>
        <li>Previous addresses of the victim and suspect.</li>
        <li>Other potential witnesses who have not yet been interviewed, such as relatives or others close to the victim’s environment.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Any unexplained death of an adult who was in the care of a guardian or caretaker should be considered as potential adult abuse and investigated similarly.</p>
    <p>Assigned members shall initiate an investigation of vulnerable adult abuse as soon as possible, but in all cases within 24 hours when there is reason to believe a crime has been committed (Min. Stat. § 626.557).</p>

    <h3>326.6 PROTECTIVE CUSTODY</h3>
    <p>Before taking an adult abuse victim into protective custody when facts indicate the adult may not be able to care for him/herself, the officer should make reasonable attempts to contact an appropriate protective services agency. Generally, removal
        of an adult abuse victim from his/her family, guardian or other responsible adult should be left to the welfare authorities when they are present or have become involved in an investigation.</p>
    <p>Generally, members of this department should remove an adult abuse victim from his/her family or guardian without a court order only when no other effective alternative is reasonably available and immediate action reasonably appears necessary to protect
        the victim. Prior to taking an adult abuse victim into protective custody, the officer should take reasonable steps to deliver the adult to another qualified legal guardian, unless it reasonably appears that the release would endanger the victim
        or result in abduction. If this is not a reasonable option, the officer shall ensure that the adult is delivered to an appropriate protective services agency or medical facility.</p>
    <p>Whenever practicable, the officer should inform a supervisor of the circumstances prior to taking an adult abuse victim into protective custody. If prior notification is not practicable, officers should contact a supervisor promptly after taking the
        adult into protective custody.</p>
    <p>When adult abuse victims are under state control, have a state-appointed guardian or there are other legal holdings for guardianship, it may be necessary or reasonable to seek a court order on behalf of the adult victim to either remove the adult
        from a dangerous environment (protective custody) or restrain a person from contact with the adult.</p>

    <h3>326.7 INTERVIEWS</h3>
    <h4>326.7.1 PRELIMINARY INTERVIEWS</h4>
    <p>Absent extenuating circumstances or impracticality, officers should audio record the preliminary interview with a suspected adult abuse victim. Officers should avoid multiple interviews with the victim and should attempt to gather only the information
        necessary to begin an investigation. When practicable, investigating officers should defer interviews until a person who is specially trained in such interviews is available.</p>
    <h4>326.7.2 DETAINING VICTIMS FOR INTERVIEWS</h4>
    <p>An officer should not detain an adult involuntarily who is suspected of being a victim of abuse solely for the purpose of an interview or physical exam without his/her consent or the consent of a guardian unless one of the following applies:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Exigent circumstances exist, such as:
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>A reasonable belief that medical issues of the adult need to be addressed immediately.</li>
                <li>A reasonable belief that the adult is or will be in danger of harm if the interview or physical exam is not immediately completed.</li>
                <li>The alleged offender is a family member or guardian and there is reason to believe the adult may be in continued danger.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>A court order or warrant has been issued.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>326.8 MEDICAL EXAMINATIONS</h3>
    <p>When an adult abuse investigation requires a medical examination, the investigating officer should obtain consent for such examination from the victim, guardian, agency or entity having legal custody of the adult. The officer should also arrange for
        the adult’s transportation to the appropriate medical facility.</p>
    <p>In cases where the alleged offender is a family member, guardian, agency or entity having legal custody and is refusing to give consent for the medical examination, officers should notify a supervisor before proceeding. If exigent circumstances do
        not exist or if state law does not provide for officers to take the adult for a medical examination, the supervisor should consider other government agencies or services that may obtain a court order for such an examination.</p>

    <h3>326.9 DRUG-ENDANGERED VICTIMS</h3>
    <p>A coordinated response by law enforcement and social services agencies is appropriate to meet the immediate and longer-term medical and safety needs of an adult abuse victim who has been exposed to the manufacturing, trafficking or use of narcotics.</p>
    <h4>326.9.1 SUPERVISOR RESPONSIBILITIES The Investigation Division supervisor should:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Work with professionals from the appropriate agencies, including the applicable adult protective services agency, other law enforcement agencies, medical service providers and local prosecutors, to develop community-specific procedures for responding
            to situations where there are adult abuse victims endangered by exposure to methamphetamine labs or the manufacture and trafficking of other drugs.</li>
        <li>Activate any available interagency response when an officer notifies the Investigation Division supervisor that he/she has responded to a drug lab or other narcotics crime scene where an adult abuse victim is present or where evidence indicates
            that an adult abuse victim lives.</li>
        <li>Develop a report format or checklist for use when officers respond to drug labs or other narcotics crime scenes. The checklist will help officers document the environmental, medical, social and other conditions that may affect the adult.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>326.9.2 OFFICER RESPONSIBILITIES</h4>
    <p>Officers responding to a drug lab or other narcotics crime scene where an adult abuse victim is present or where there is evidence that an adult abuse victim lives should:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Document the environmental, medical, social and other conditions of the adult, using photography as appropriate and the checklist or form developed for this purpose.</li>
        <li>Notify the Investigation Division supervisor so an interagency response can begin.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>326.10 STATE MANDATES AND OTHER RELEVANT LAWS</h3>
    <p>Minnesota requires or permits the following:</p>
    <h4>326.10.1 RECORDS SECTION RESPONSIBILITIES</h4>
    <p>The Records Section is responsible for:</a>
    </p>

        <li>Providing a copy of the adult abuse report to the applicable entity in the county responsible for receiving such reports as required by law.</li>
        <li>Retaining the original adult abuse report with the initial case file.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>326.11 TRAINING</h3>
    <p>The Department should provide training on best practices in adult abuse investigations to members tasked with investigating these cases. The training should include:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Participating in multidisciplinary investigations, as appropriate.</li>
        <li>Conducting interviews.</li>
        <li>Availability of therapy services for adults and families.</li>
        <li>Availability of specialized forensic medical exams.</li>

    <h2>328 - Disciminatory Harassment</h2>
    <h3>328.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>This policy is intended to prevent department members from being subjected to discrimination or sexual harassment.</p>

    <h3>328.2 POLICY</h3>
    <p>The Metro Transit Police Department is an equal opportunity employer and is committed to creating and maintaining a work environment that is free of all forms of discriminatory harassment, including sexual harassment and retaliation. The Department
        will not tolerate, discrimination against employees in hiring, promotion, discharge, compensation, fringe benefits and other privileges of employment. The Department will take preventive and corrective action to address any behavior that violates
        this policy or the rights it is designed to protect.</p>
    <p>The non-discrimination policies of the Department may be more comprehensive than state or federal law. Conduct that violates this policy may not violate state or federal law but still could subject a member to discipline. Employees may also refer
        to Metropolitan Council Policy 4-2-1 on Discrimination, Harassment and Inappropriate Behavior for additional information.</p>

    <h3>328.3 DISCRIMINATION PROHIBITED</h3>
    <h4>328.3.1 DISCRIMINATION</h4>
    <p>The Department prohibits all forms of discrimination, including any employment-related action by a member that adversely affects an applicant or member and is based on race, color, religion, sex, age, national origin or ancestry, genetic information,
        disability, military service, sexual orientation and other classifications protected by law.</p>
    <p>Discriminatory harassment, including sexual harassment, is verbal or physical conduct that demeans or shows hostility or aversion toward an individual based upon that individual’s protected class. It has the effect of interfering with an individual’s
        work performance or creating a hostile or abusive work environment.</p>
    <p>Conduct that may, under certain circumstances, constitute discriminatory harassment, can include making derogatory comments, crude and offensive statements or remarks, making slurs or off-color jokes, stereotyping, engaging in threatening acts, making
        indecent gestures, pictures, cartoons, posters or material, making inappropriate physical contact, or using written material or department equipment and/or systems to transmit or receive offensive material, statements or pictures. Such conduct
        is contrary to department policy and to the department’s commitment to an environment that is free of discrimination.</p>
    <h4>328.3.2 SEXUAL HARASSMENT</h4>
    <p>The Department prohibits all forms of discrimination and discriminatory harassment, including sexual harassment. It is unlawful to harass an applicant or a member because of that person’s sex.</p>
    <p>Sexual harassment includes, but is not limited to, unwelcome sexual advances, requests for sexual favors or other verbal, visual or physical conduct of a sexual nature when:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Submission to such conduct is made either explicitly or implicitly a term or condition of employment, position or compensation.</li>
        <li>Submission to, or rejection of, such conduct is used as the basis for any employment decisions affecting the member.</li>
        <li>Such conduct has the purpose or effect of substantially interfering with a member's work performance or creating an intimidating, hostile or offensive work environment.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>328.3.3 ADDITIONAL CONSIDERATIONS</h4>
    <p>Discrimination and discriminatory harassment do not include actions that are in accordance with established rules, principles or standards including:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Acts or omission of acts based solely upon bona fide occupational qualifications under the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) or the Minnesota Department of Human Rights.</li>
        <li>Bona fide requests or demands by a supervisor that a member improve his/her work quality or output, that the member report to the job site on time, that the member comply with Metropolitan Council / Metro Transit rules or regulations, or any other
            appropriate work- related communication between supervisor and member.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>328.3.4 RETALIATION</h4>
    <p>Retaliation is treating a person differently or engaging in acts of reprisal or intimidation against the person because he/she has engaged in protected activity, filed a charge of discrimination, participated in an investigation or opposed a discriminatory
        practice. Retaliation will not be tolerated.</p>

    <h3>328.4 RESPONSIBILITIES</h3>
    <p>This policy applies to all department personnel. All members shall follow the intent of these guidelines in a manner that reflects department policy, professional law enforcement standards and the best interest of the Department and its mission.</p>
    <p>Members are encouraged to promptly report any discriminatory, retaliatory or harassing conduct or known violations of this policy to a supervisor. Any member who is not comfortable with reporting violations of this policy to his/her immediate supervisor
        may bypass the chain of command and make the report to a higher ranking supervisor or manager. Complaints may also be filed with the Chief of Police, Director of Human Resources or the General Manager.</p>
    <p>Any member who believes, in good faith, that he/she has been discriminated against, harassed, subjected to retaliation, or who has observed harassment or discrimination, is encouraged to promptly report such conduct in accordance with the procedures
        set forth in this policy.</p>
    <p>Supervisors and managers receiving information regarding alleged violations of this policy shall determine if there is any basis for the allegation and shall proceed with resolution as stated below.</p>
    <h4>328.4.1 SUPERVISOR RESPONSIBILITY</h4>
    <p>Each supervisor and manager shall:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Continually monitor the work environment and strive to ensure that it is free from all types of unlawful discrimination, including sexual harassment and retaliation.</li>
        <li>Take prompt, appropriate action within their work units to avoid and minimize the incidence of any form of discrimination, harassment or retaliation.</li>
        <li>Ensure that their subordinates understand their responsibilities under this policy.</li>
        <li>Ensure that members who make complaints or who oppose any unlawful employment practices are protected from retaliation and that such matters are kept confidential to the extent possible.</li>
        <li>Notify the Chief of Police or Director of Human Resources in writing of the circumstances surrounding any reported allegations or observed acts of discrimination, harassment or retaliation no later than the next business day.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>328.4.2 SUPERVISOR'S ROLE</h4>
    <p>Because of differences in individual values, supervisors and managers may find it difficult to recognize that their behavior or the behavior of others is discriminatory, harassing or retaliatory. Supervisors and managers shall be aware of the following
        considerations:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Behavior of supervisors and managers should represent the values of the Department and professional law enforcement standards.</li>
        <li>False or mistaken accusations of discrimination, harassment or retaliation can have negative effects on the careers of innocent members.</li>
        <li>Supervisors and managers must act promptly and responsibly in the resolution of such situations.</li>
        <li>Supervisors and managers shall make a timely determination regarding the substance of any allegation based upon all available facts.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Nothing in this section shall be construed to prevent supervisors or managers from discharging supervisory or management responsibilities, such as determining duty assignments, evaluating or counseling members or issuing discipline, in a manner that
        is consistent with established procedures.</p>

    <h3>328.5 INVESTIGATION OF COMPLAINTS</h3>
    <p>Various methods of resolution exist. During the pendency of any such investigation, the supervisor of the involved members should take prompt and reasonable steps to mitigate or eliminate any continuing abusive or hostile work environment. It is the
        policy of the Department that all complaints of discrimination or harassment shall be fully documented and investigated in a prompt and thorough manner. The participating or opposing member should be protected against retaliation, and the complaint
        and related investigation should be kept confidential to the extent possible.</p>
    <h4>328.4.2 SUPERVISORY RESOLUTION</h4>
    <p>Members who believe they are experiencing discrimination, harassment or retaliation should be encouraged to inform the individual that his/her behavior is unwelcome, offensive, unprofessional or inappropriate. However, if the member feels uncomfortable,
        threatened or has difficulty expressing his/her concern, or if this does not resolve the concern, assistance should be sought from a supervisor or manager who is a rank higher than the alleged transgressor.</p>
    <h4>328.5.2 FORMAL INVESTIGATION</h4>
    <p>If the complaint cannot be satisfactorily resolved through the process described above, a formal investigation will be conducted.</p>
    <p>The person assigned to investigate the complaint will have full authority to investigate all aspects of the complaint. Investigative authority includes access to records and the cooperation of any members involved. No influence will be used to suppress
        any complaint and no member will be subject to retaliation or reprisal for filing a complaint, encouraging others to file a complaint or for offering testimony or evidence in any investigation.</p>
    <p>Formal investigation of the complaint will be confidential to the extent possible and will include, but not be limited to, details of the specific incident, frequency, dates of occurrences and names of any witnesses. Witnesses will be advised regarding
        the prohibition against retaliation, and that a disciplinary process, up to and including termination, may result if retaliation occurs.</p>
    <p>Members who believe they have been discriminated against, harassed or retaliated against because of their protected status are encouraged to follow the chain of command but may also file a complaint directly with the Chief of Police, Director of Human
        Resources or the General Manager.</p>
    <h4>328.5.3 ALTERNATIVE COMPLAINT PROCESS</h4>
    <p>No provision of this policy shall be construed to prevent any member from seeking legal redress outside the Department. Members who believe that they have been harassed, discriminated or retaliated against are entitled to bring complaints of employment
        discrimination to federal, state and/or local agencies responsible for investigating such allegations. Specific time limitations apply to the filing of such charges. Members are advised that proceeding with complaints under the provisions of this
        policy does not in any way affect those filing requirements.</p>

    <h3>328.6 NOTIFICATION OF DISPOSITION</h3>
    <p>The complainant and/or victim will be notified in writing of the disposition of the investigation and the actions taken to remedy or address the circumstances giving rise to the complaint.</p>

    <h3>328.7 DOCUMENTATION OF COMPLAINTS</h3>
    <p>All complaints or allegations shall be thoroughly documented on forms and in a manner designated by the Chief of Police. The outcome of all reports shall be:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Approved by the Chief of Police, the General Manager or Director if more appropriate.</li>
        <li>Maintained for the period established in the department’s retention schedule.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>328.8 TRAINING</h3>
    <p>All new members shall be provided with a copy of this policy as part of their orientation. The policy shall be reviewed with each new member. The member shall certify by signing the prescribed form that he/she has been advised of this policy, is aware
        of and understands its contents and agrees to abide by its provisions during his/her term of employment.</p>
    <p>All members shall receive annual training on the requirements of this policy and shall certify by signing the prescribed form that they have reviewed the policy, understand its contents and agree that they will continue to abide by its provisions.</p>

                <li>Whether there are immediate family, relative or community resources that would offer protection or support to the child.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Forms that may be required by the county social services agency or other written notification shall be completed and faxed or delivered to the county social services agency as soon as possible but always within 72 hours, exclusive of weekends
            and holidays.</li>
        <li>Approved investigation reports should be forwarded to the county social services agency as soon as practical.</li>
        <li>When the child abuse occurred at a facility or by a person from a facility that requires a state license (e.g., foster homes, group homes, day care), notification shall also be made to the agency responsible for licensing the facility (Minn. Stat.
            § 626.556).</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>330.4 QUALIFIED INVESTIGATORS</h3>
    <p>Qualified investigators should be available for child abuse investigations. These investigators should:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Conduct interviews in child appropriate interview facilities.</li>
        <li>Be familiar with forensic interview techniques specific to child abuse investigations.</li>
        <li>Present all cases of alleged child abuse to the prosecutor for review.</li>
        <li>Coordinate with other enforcement agencies, social service agencies and school administrators as needed.</li>
        <li>Provide referrals to therapy services, victim advocates, guardians and support for the child and family as appropriate.</li>
        <li>Participate in or coordinate with multidisciplinary investigative teams as applicable.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>330.5 INVESTIGATIONS AND REPORTING</h3>
    <p>In all reported or suspected cases of child abuse, a report will be written. Officers shall write a report even if the allegations appear unfounded or unsubstantiated.</p>
    <p>Investigations and reports related to suspected cases of child abuse should address, as applicable:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>The overall basis for the contact. This should be done by the investigating officer in all circumstances where a suspected child abuse victim was contacted.</li>
        <li>The exigent circumstances that existed if officers interviewed the child victim without the presence of a parent or guardian.</li>
        <li>Any relevant statements the child may have made and to whom he/she made the statements.</li>
        <li>If a child was taken into protective custody, the reasons, the name and title of the person making the decision, and why other alternatives were not appropriate.</li>
        <li>Documentation of any visible injuries or any injuries identified by the child. This should include photographs of such injuries, if practicable.</li>
        <li>Whether the child victim was transported for medical treatment or a medical examination.</li>
        <li>Whether the victim identified a household member as the alleged perpetrator, and a list of the names of any other children who may reside in the residence.</li>
        <li>Identification of any prior related reports or allegations of child abuse, including other jurisdictions, as reasonably known.</li>
        <li>Previous addresses of the victim and suspect.</li>
        <li>Other potential witnesses who have not yet been interviewed, such as relatives or others close to the victim's environment.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>All cases of the unexplained death of a child should be investigated as thoroughly as if it had been a case of suspected child abuse (e.g., a sudden or unexplained death of an infant).</p>

    <h3>330.6 PROTECTIVE CUSTODY</h3>
    <p>Before taking any child into protective custody, the officer should make reasonable attempts to contact the county social services agency. Generally, removal of a child from his/her family, guardian or other responsible adult should be left to the child welfare authorities when they are present or have become involved in an investigation.</p>
    <p>Generally, members of this department should remove a child from his/her parent or guardian without a court order only when no other effective alternative is reasonably available and immediate action reasonably appears necessary to protect the child.
        Prior to taking a child into protective custody, the officer should take reasonable steps to deliver the child to another qualified parent or legal guardian, unless it reasonably appears that the release would endanger the child or result in abduction.
        If this is not a reasonable option, the officer shall ensure that the child is delivered to the county social services agency.</p>
    <p>Whenever practicable, the officer should inform a supervisor of the circumstances prior to taking a child into protective custody. If prior notification is not practicable, officers should contact a supervisor promptly after taking a child into protective
        custody.</p>
    <p>Children may only be removed from a parent or guardian in the following situations (Minn. Stat. § 260C.175):</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>When a court has issued an order for removal.</li>
        <li>When a child is found in surroundings or conditions that pose an imminent threat to the child's health or welfare or that a peace officer reasonably believes pose an imminent threat to the child's health or welfare.</li>
        <li>If an Indian child is a resident of a reservation or is domiciled on a reservation but temporarily located off the reservation, taking the child into custody under this clause shall be consistent with the Indian Child Welfare Act (25 USC § 1922).</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>330.6.1 NOTICE TO PARENT OR CUSTODIAN</h4>
    <p>Whenever an officer takes a child into protective custody, the officer shall notify the parent or custodian that he/she may request that the child be placed with a relative or a designated caregiver instead of in a shelter care facility. The officer
        also shall give the parent or custodian a list, published by the Minnesota Department of Human Services, of names, addresses and telephone numbers of social services agencies that offer child welfare services. If the parent or custodian was not
        present when the child was removed from the residence, the list shall be left with an adult who is on the premises or left in a conspicuous place on the premises if no adult is present. If the officer has reason to believe the parent or custodian
        is not able to read and understand English, the officer must provide a list that is written in the language of the parent or custodian (Minn. Stat.</p>
    <p>§ 260C.175; Minn. Stat. § 260C.181).</p>
    <p>The above notifications may be made by the county social services agency representative if he/ she is at the scene.</p>
    <h4>330.6.2 SAFE PLACE FOR NEWBORNS</h4>
    <p>A person may leave an unharmed newborn less than seven days old with the staff of a hospital, urgent care facility or ambulance service without being subject to prosecution (Minn. Stat. § 609.3785). The responsible social service agency is charged with addressing these matters but may contact law enforcement if child abuse is suspected (Minn. Stat. § 145.902; Minn. Stat. § 609.3785).</p>

    <h3>330.7 INTERVIEWS</h3>
    <h4>330.7.1 PRELIMINARY INTERVIEWS</h4>
    <p>Absent extenuating circumstances or impracticality, officers should record the preliminary interview with suspected child abuse victims. Officers should avoid multiple interviews with a child victim and should attempt to gather only the information
        necessary to begin an investigation. When practicable, investigating officers should defer interviews until a person who is specially trained in such interviews is available. Generally, child victims should not be interviewed in the home or location
        where the alleged abuse occurred.</p>
    <h4>330.7.2 DETAINING ABUSE VICTIMS FOR INTERVIEW</h4>
    <p>An officer should not detain a child involuntarily who is suspected of being a victim of child abuse solely for the purpose of an interview or physical exam without the consent of a parent or guardian unless one of the following applies:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Exigent circumstances exist, such as:
            <ol>
                <li>A reasonable belief that medical issues of the child need to be addressed immediately.</li>
                <li>A reasonable belief that the child is or will be in danger of harm if the interview or physical exam is not immediately completed.</li>
                <li>The alleged offender is the custodial parent or guardian and there is reason to believe the child may be in continued danger.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>A court order or warrant has been issued.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>330.7.3 NOTIFICATION TO PARENTS</h4>
    <p>Generally, officers should cooperate with parents and guardians and seek consent prior to conducting interviews of children. However, when reasonably necessary, state law grants officers the authority to interview a child who is the alleged victim
        of abuse or neglect, and any other children who currently reside or have resided with the alleged victim, without parental consent (Minn. Stat. § 626.556, Subd. 10).</p>
    <p>The interview may take place at school or at any facility or other place where the alleged victim or other children might be found, or the child may be transported to, and the interview conducted at, a place that is appropriate for the interview and
        has been designated by the local welfare agency or law enforcement agency. The interview may take place outside the presence of the alleged offender or parent, legal custodian, guardian or school official (Minn. Stat. § 626.556, Subd. 10).</p>
    <p>The officer shall notify the parent, legal custodian or guardian that the interview occurred as soon as reasonably practicable after the interview, unless the juvenile court has determined that reasonable cause exists to withhold the information (Minn.
        Stat. § 626.556, Subd. 10).</p>
    <h4>330.7.4 INTERVIEWS AT SCHOOL</h4>
    <p>If officers assigned to investigate a report of maltreatment determine that an interview should take place on school property, written notification of the intent to interview the child on school property must be received by school officials prior
        to the interview. The notification shall include the name of the child to be interviewed, the purpose of the interview and a reference to the statutory authority to conduct an interview on school property (Minn. Stat. § 626.556, Subd. 10).</p>
    <p>The investigating officer shall determine who may attend the interview, although school officials may set reasonable conditions as to the time, place and manner of the interview (Minn. Stat. § 626.556, Subd. 10).</p>
    <h4>330.7.5 DOCUMENTING AND RECORDING INTERVIEWS</h4>
    <p>Any statement made by an alleged child abuse victim during the course of a criminal investigation shall be documented. The documentation of the interview must contain, at a minimum (Minn. Stat. § 626.561):</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>The date, time, place and duration of the interview.</li>
        <li>The identity of the persons present at the interview.</li>
        <li>A summary of the information obtained during the interview if it was not audio recorded.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Members should follow the written guidelines of the county attorney's office regarding recording interviews of a child abuse victim.</p>

    <h3>330.8 MEDICAL EXAMINATIONS</h3>
    <p>If the child has been the victim of abuse that requires a medical examination, the investigating officer should obtain consent for such examination from the appropriate parent, guardian or agency having legal custody of the child. The officer should
        also arrange for the child's transportation to the appropriate medical facility.</p>
    <p>In cases where the alleged offender is the custodial parent or guardian and is refusing consent for the medical examination, officers should notify a supervisor before proceeding. If exigent circumstances do not exist or if state law does not provide
        for officers to take the child for a medical examination, the notified supervisor should consider obtaining a court order for such an examination.</p>

    <h3>330.9 DRUG-ENDANGERED CHILDREN</h3>
    <p>A coordinated response by law enforcement and social services agencies is appropriate to meet the immediate and longer-term medical and safety needs of children exposed to the manufacturing, trafficking or use of narcotics.</p>
    <h4>330.9.1 SUPERVISOR RESPONSIBILITIES The Investigation Division supervisor should:</h4>
    <ol>
        <li>Work with professionals from the appropriate agencies, including the county social services agency, other law enforcement agencies, medical service providers and local prosecutors to develop community specific procedures for responding to situations
            where there are children endangered by exposure to methamphetamine labs or the manufacture and trafficking of other drugs.</li>
        <li>Activate any available interagency response when an officer notifies the Investigation Division supervisor that the officer has responded to a drug lab or other narcotics crime scene where a child is present or where evidence indicates that a
            child lives there.</li>
        <li>Develop a report format or checklist for use when officers respond to drug labs or other narcotics crime scenes. The checklist will help officers document the environmental, medical, social and other conditions that may affect the child.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>330.9.2 OFFICER RESPONSIBILITIES</h4>
    <p>Officers responding to a drug lab or other narcotics crime scene where a child is present or where there is evidence that a child lives should:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Document the environmental, medical, social and other conditions of the child using photography as appropriate and the checklist or form developed for this purpose.</li>
        <li>Notify the Investigation Division supervisor so an interagency response can begin.p>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>330.9.3 SCHOOL NOTIFICATION</h4>
    <p>If a juvenile is taken into protective custody after being found in an area where methamphetamine was being manufactured or attempted to be manufactured, or where any chemical substances, paraphernalia or waste products related to methamphetamine
        are stored, the officer who took the juvenile into custody shall notify the chief administrative officer of the juvenile’s school (Minn. Stat. § 260C.171, Subd. 6).</p>

    <h3>330.10 STATE MANDATES AND OTHER RELEVANT LAWS</h3>
    <p>Minnesota requires or permits the following:</p>
    <h4>330.10.1 RELEASE OF REPORTS</h4>
    <p>Information related to incidents of child abuse or suspected child abuse shall be confidential and may only be disclosed pursuant to state law and the Records Maintenance and Release Policy (Minn. Stat. § 626.556, Subd. 11).</p>
    <h4>330.10.2 CHILD MORTALITY REVIEW PANELS</h4>
    <p>Child mortality review panels are entitled to access all investigative information of law enforcement agencies regarding the death of a child. This department shall cooperate fully with any such team and investigation (Minn. Stat. § 256.01, Subd. 12).</p>
    <h4>330.10.3 COORDINATION WITH SOCIAL SERVICES</h4>
    <p>In every case of child abuse that would require notification to a local county social services agency, the investigating officer shall coordinate the planning and execution of the investigation and assessment efforts to avoid a duplication of fact-finding
        efforts and multiple interviews. The investigating officer shall prepare a report separate from the social services agency (Minn. Stat. § 626.556, Subd. 10).</p>
    <h4>330.10.4 NOTIFICATION PROCESS</h4>
    <p>The Patrol Supervisor is responsible for ensuring the mandatory notifications to the county social service agency are carried out. This should be achieved, in part, by establishing and reviewing related procedures and through ongoing training (Minn.
        Stat. § 626.556).</p>
    <h4>330.10.5 COURT-ORDERED FIREARM SURRENDERS</h4>
    </ol>
    <p>Although not required, this department generally will accept firearms surrendered by a court order from an abusing party or defendant. A decision to refuse a surrendered firearm should be approved by a supervisor.</p>
    <p>Firearms will normally be surrendered at the Metro Transit Police Department; however, when encountering someone in the field who wishes to surrender a firearm, officers should make reasonable efforts to accommodate the request.</p>
    <p>Surrendered firearms should be collected and submitted to the ﻿Property and Evidence﻿ in accordance with the ﻿Property and Evidence﻿ Policy.</p>

    <h3>330.11 TRAINING</h3>
    <p>The Professional Standards Unit should provide training on best practices in child abuse investigations to members tasked with investigating these cases. The training should include:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Participating in multidisciplinary investigations, as appropriate.</li>
        <li>Conducting forensic interviews.</li>
        <li>Availability of therapy services for children and families.</li>
        <li>Availability of specialized forensic medical exams.</li>
        <li>Cultural competence (including interpretive services) related to child abuse investigations.</li>
        <li>Availability of victim advocate or guardian ad litem support.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>332 - Missing Persons</h2>
    <h3>332.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>This policy provides guidance for handling missing person investigations.</p>
    <h4>332.1.1 DEFINITIONS</h4>
    <p>Definitions related to this policy include:</p>
    <p><strong>Endangered</strong> - A person the Department has confirmed is missing and there is sufficient evidence to indicate that the person is at risk of physical injury or death. Examples include (Minn. Stat. § 299C.52):</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>The person is missing because of a confirmed abduction or under circumstances that indicate the person's disappearance was not voluntary.</li>
        <li>The person is missing under known dangerous circumstances.</li>
        <li>The person is missing more than 30 days.</li>
        <li>The person is under the age of 21 and at least one other factor is applicable.</li>
        <li>There is evidence that the person is in need of medical attention or prescription medication.</li>
        <li>The person does not have a pattern of running away or disappearing.</li>
        <li>The person is mentally impaired.</li>
        <li>There is evidence that a non-custodial parent may have abducted the person.</li>
        <li>The person has been the subject of past threats or acts of violence.</li>
        <li>There is evidence that the person is lost in the wilderness, backcountry or outdoors where survival is precarious and search-and-rescue efforts are critical.</li>
        <li>Any other factor the Department deems to indicate the person may be at risk of physical injury or death, including a determination by another law enforcement agency that the person is missing and endangered.</li>
        <li>There is sufficient evidence that a child is with a person who presents a threat of immediate physical injury to the child or physical or sexual abuse of the child.</li>
    </ol>
    <p><strong>Missing person</strong> - Any person who is reported missing to law enforcement when that person’s location is unknown. This includes any person under the age of 18 or who is certified or known to be mentally incompetent (Minn. Stat. § 299C.52).</p>
    <p><strong>Missing person networks</strong> - Databases or computer networks that are available to law enforcement and are suitable for obtaining information related to missing person investigations. This includes the National Crime Information Center
        (NCIC), the Minnesota Justice Information Services (MNJIS), the Minnesota Missing and Unidentified Persons Clearinghouse and the Minnesota Crime Alert Network.</p>

    <h3>332.2 POLICY</h3>
    <p>The Metro Transit Police Department does not consider any report of a missing person to be routine and assumes that the missing person is in need of immediate assistance until an investigation reveals otherwise. Priority shall be given to missing
        person cases over property- related cases. Members will initiate an investigation into all reports of missing persons, regardless of the length of time the person has been missing.</p>

    <h3>332.3 REQUIRED FORMS AND BIOLOGICAL SAMPLE COLLECTION KITS</h3>
    <p>The Investigation Division supervisor shall ensure the following forms and kits are developed and available:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Missing person report form</li>
        <li>Missing person investigation checklist that provides investigation guidelines and resources that could be helpful in the early hours of a missing person investigation</li>
        <li>Missing person school notification form</li>
        <li>Medical records release form</li>
        <li>Biological sample collection kits</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>332.4 ACCEPTANCE OF REPORTS</h3>
    <p>Any member encountering a person who wishes to report a missing person or runaway shall render assistance without delay. This can be accomplished by accepting the report via telephone or in person and initiating the investigation. Those members who
        do not take such reports or who are unable to give immediate assistance shall promptly dispatch or alert a member who can take the report.</p>
    <p>A report shall be accepted in all cases and regardless of where the person was last seen, where the person resides or any question of jurisdiction.</p>

    <h3>332.5 INITIAL INVESTIGATION</h3>
    <p>Officers or other members conducting the initial investigation of a missing person should take the following investigative actions as applicable:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Respond to a dispatched call as soon as practicable. Obtain a detailed description of the missing person, as well as a description of any related vehicle and/or abductor.</li>
        <li>Interview the reporting party and any witnesses to determine whether the person qualifies as a missing person and, if so, whether the person may be endangered (Minn. Stat. § 299C.53, Subd. 1(b)). Interviews should be conducted separately, if practicable.</li>
        <li>Consult with the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) if the person is determined to be an endangered missing person (Minn. Stat. § 299C.53, Subd. 1(b)).</li>
        <li>Canvass the last known area where the missing person was seen, if known. A search of the location where the incident took place, if known, should also be conducted and a search warrant obtained if necessary.</li>
        <li>Determine when, where and by whom the missing person was last seen. Interview the person who last had contact with the missing person.</li>
        <li>Notify a supervisor immediately if there is evidence that a missing person is either endangered or may qualify for a public alert, or both (see the Public Alerts Policy).</li>
        <li>Broadcast a “Be on the Look-Out” (BOLO) bulletin if the person is under 18 years of age or there is evidence that the missing person is endangered. The BOLO should be broadcast as soon as practicable but in no event more than one hour after determining
            the missing person is under 18 years of age or may be endangered.</li>
        <li>Relay known details to all on-duty personnel as well as other local or surrounding law enforcement agencies using local and state databases.</li>
        <li>Ensure that entries are made into the appropriate missing person networks:
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>Immediately, when the missing person is endangered.</li>
                <li>In all other cases, as soon as practicable, but not later than two hours from the time of the initial report.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Complete the appropriate report forms accurately and completely and initiate a search as applicable under the facts.</li>
        <li>Collect and/or review:
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>A photograph and fingerprint card of the missing person, if available (Minn. Stat. § 299C.54, Subd. 2).</li>
                <li>A voluntarily provided biological sample of the missing person, if available (e.g., toothbrush, hairbrush).</li>
                <li>Any documents that may assist in the investigation, such as court orders regarding custody.</li>
                <li>Any other evidence that may assist in the investigation, including personal electronic devices (e.g., cell phones, computers).</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>When circumstances permit and if appropriate, attempt to determine the missing person's location through his/her telecommunications carrier.</li>
        <li>Contact the appropriate agency if the report relates to a missing person report previously made to another agency and that agency is actively investigating the report. When this is not practicable, the information should be documented in an appropriate
            report for transmission</li>
    </ol>
    <p>to the appropriate agency. If the information relates to an endangered missing person, the member should notify a supervisor and proceed with reasonable steps to locate the missing person.</p>
    <h4>332.5.1 CRIME SCENE INVESTIGATION AND MANAGEMENT</h4>
    <p>If a crime scene is identified, it should be secured and a command post or operation base located at a reasonable distance from the crime scene. Staff and assign the responsibilities for command post supervisor, media specialist, search coordinator,
        investigative coordinator, communication officer and support unit coordinator. Provide two liaison officers (one at the command post and one at the crime scene). The role of the liaison at the home will include facilitating support and advocacy
        for the family.</p>
    <p>The investigation of the scene and the crime should consider various elements, including:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Establishing the ability to “trap and trace” all incoming calls. Consider setting up a separate telephone line or cellular telephone for department use and follow-up on all leads.</li>
        <li>Compiling a list of known sex offenders in the region.</li>
        <li>In cases of infant abduction, investigating claims of home births made in the area.</li>
        <li>In cases involving children, obtaining child protective agency records for reports of child abuse.</li>
        <li>Reviewing records for previous incidents related to the missing person and prior law enforcement activity in the area, including prowlers, indecent exposure, attempted abductions, etc.</li>
        <li>Obtaining the missing person’s medical and dental records, fingerprints and a biological sample when practicable or within 30 days.</li>
        <li>Creating a missing person profile with detailed information obtained from records and interviews with family and friends, describing the missing person’s heath, relationships, personality, problems, life experiences, plans, equipment, etc.</li>
        <li>Interviewing delivery personnel, employees of gas, water, electric and cable companies, taxi drivers, post office personnel, sanitation workers, etc.</li>
        <li>Determining if outside help is needed and the merits of utilizing local, state and federal resources related to specialized investigative needs, including:
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>Investigative resources.</li>
                <li>Interpretive resources.</li>
                <li>Telephone services, such as traps, traces and triangulation.</li>
                <li>Media assistance from local and national sources.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Using secure electronic communication information, such as the missing person’s cellular telephone number, e-mail address and information from social networking sites.</li>
        <li>Appointing an officer to communicate with the family/reporting party or their designee. The officer will be the primary point of contact for the family/reporting party or their designee, and should provide contact information and the family information
            packet (if available) to the family/reporting party or their designee.</li>
        <li>Providing general information to the family/reporting party or their designee about the handling of the missing person case or about any intended efforts, only to the extent that disclosure would not adversely affect the department’s ability to
            locate or protect the missing person or to apprehend or criminally prosecute any person in connection to the case.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>332.6 REPORT PROCEDURES AND ROUTING</h3>
    <p>Members should complete all missing person reports and forms promptly and advise the appropriate supervisor as soon as a missing person report is ready for review.</p>
    <h4>332.6.1 SUPERVISOR RESPONSIBILITIES</h4>
    <p>The responsibilities of the supervisor shall include, but are not limited to:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Reviewing and approving missing person reports upon receipt.</p>
            <ol class="decimal">

    <h2>334 - Public Alerts</h2>
    <h3>334.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this policy is to provide guidelines for alerting the public to important information and soliciting public aid when appropriate.</p>

    <h3>334.2 POLICY</h3>
    <p>Public alerts may be employed using the Emergency Alert System (EAS), local radio, television and press organizations and other groups to notify the public of incidents, or enlist the aid of the public, when the exchange of information may enhance
        the safety of the community. Various types of alerts may be available based upon each situation and the alert system’s individual criteria.</p>

    <h3>334.3 RESPONSIBILITIES</h3>
    <h4>334.3.1 EMPLOYEE RESPONSIBILITIES</h4>
    <p>Employees of the Metro Transit Police Department should notify their supervisor, Shift Supervisor or Investigation Division Supervisor as soon as practicable upon learning of a situation where public notification, a warning or enlisting the help of
        the media and public could assist in locating a missing person, apprehending a dangerous person or gathering information.</p>
    <h4>334.3.2 SUPERVISOR RESPONSIBILITIES</h4>
    <p>A supervisor apprised of the need for a public alert is responsible to make the appropriate notifications based upon the circumstances of each situation. The supervisor shall promptly notify the Chief of Police, the Patrol Captain and the Public Information
        Officer when any public alert is generated.</p>
    <p>The supervisor in charge of the investigation to which the alert relates is responsible for the following:</p>

        <li>Ensuring all appropriate reports are completed</li>
        <li>Preparing an after-action evaluation of the investigation to be forwarded to the Patrol Captain and Deputy Chief</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>334.4 AMBER ALERTS</h3>
    <p>America's Missing: Broadcast Emergency Response (AMBER) Alert™ is the recruitment of public assistance to locate an abducted child via a widespread media alert. Utilizing the assistance of local radio, television and press affiliates, the public will
        be notified of the circumstances of a child's abduction and how it can assist law enforcement in the child's recovery. The goal of the AMBER Alert program is the safe return of an abducted child by establishing an effective</p>
    <p>partnership between the community, the media and law enforcement through the Minnesota Crime Alert Network (Minn. Stat. § 299A.61 Subd. 1).</p>
    <h4>334.4.1 CRITERIA</h4>
    <p>Any non-familial case in which an individual is abducted and the public can assist will trigger the activation of either the AMBER Alert and/or the Minnesota Crime Alert Network (MCAN) to inform the public and request its assistance in locating the
        individual.</p>
    <p>The criteria for issuance of an Amber Alert are as follows:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>A child 17 years of age or younger was abducted and there is reason to believe the victim is in imminent danger of serious bodily injury or death.</li>
        <li>There is information available to disseminate to the general public that could assist with the safe recovery of the victim and/or the apprehension of the suspect.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>An AMBER Alert should not be requested if there is no information to distribute.</p>
    <h4>334.4.2PROCEDURE</h4>
    <p>The supervisor shall review the AMBER Alert checklist provided by the Bureau of Criminal Apprehension (BCA) to determine whether the abduction meets the AMBER Alert criteria.</p>
    <p>As soon as possible, Records Section personnel shall enter the child’s name and other critical data into the National Crime Information Center (NCIC), with appropriate flags.</p>
    <p>If the AMBER Alert criteria is met, the supervisor, Shift Supervisor or Investigation Division supervisor will notify the Operations Center at the BCA. The BCA will determine whether an AMBER Alert will be issued and, if so, will activate the Minnesota
        Emergency Alert System (EAS) through the Minnesota Department of Public Safety (DPS) Division of Homeland Security and Emergency Management (HSEM).</p>
    <p>BCA will manage press notifications through the EAS.</p>
    <p>As additional information becomes available, the BCA shall be apprised and they will disseminate the information, as appropriate.</p>
    <p>When the child is found, or the alert should be cancelled for other reasons, the Investigation Division supervisor shall immediately notify BCA with the pertinent information.</p>

    <h3>334.5 MINNESOTA CRIME ALERT NETWORK</h3>
    <p>MCAN is a statewide communications network that enables law enforcement agencies to quickly alert the public (Minn. Stat. § 299A.61). In cases where the AMBER Alert criteria are not met, MCAN can be activated to notify the public and request information
        on the case. Law enforcement agencies, businesses, schools and community members participate in the network.</p>
    <h4>334.5.1 CRITERIA</h4>
    <p>MCAN is available for disseminating information regarding the commission of crimes, including information on missing and endangered children or vulnerable adults, or attempts to reduce theft and other crime.</p>
    <h4>334.5.2 PROCEDURE</h4>
    <p>If a supervisor determines that a MCAN alert should be requested, the supervisor should contact the BCA Operations Center and provide the requested information.</p>
    <p>The Public Information Officer should prepare a press release that includes all available information that might strengthen the assistance by the public or other law enforcement agencies. It should be updated with additional information as it becomes
        available and useful. All media releases should be coordinated with the BCA. In the event of a confirmed child abduction, whether or not an AMBER Alert or MCAN alert is activated, procedures designed to inform the media should be followed. Initial
        information to release may include, but is not limited to:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>The nature of the crime that has occurred.</li>
        <li>The victim’s identity, age and description, if relevant.</li>

    <h3>338.3 PREVENTING AND PREPARING FOR LIKELY HATE OR PREJUDICE CRIMES</h3>
    <p>While it is recognized that not all crime can be prevented, this department is committed to taking a proactive approach to preventing and preparing for likely hate or prejudice crimes by among other things:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Officers should make an affirmative effort to establish contact with persons and groups within the community who are likely targets of hate crimes to form and cooperate with prevention and response networks.</li>
        <li>Providing victim assistance and follow-up as outlined below, including community follow-up.</li>
        <li>Educating community and civic groups relating to hate crime laws.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>338.4 PROCEDURE FOR INVESTIGATING HATE OR PREJUDICE CRIMES</h3>
    <p>Whenever any member of this department receives a report of a suspected hate or prejudice crime or other activity that reasonably appears to involve a potential hate or prejudice crime, the following should occur:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Officers will be promptly assigned to contact the victim, witness or reporting party to investigate the matter further as circumstances may dictate.</li>
        <li>A supervisor should be notified of the circumstances as soon as practicable.</li>
        <li>Once “in progress” aspects of any such situation have been stabilized (e.g., treatment of victims or apprehension of present suspects), the assigned officers will take all reasonable steps to preserve available evidence that may tend to establish
            that a hate or prejudice crime was involved.</li>
        <li>The assigned officers will interview available witnesses, victims and others to determine what circumstances, if any, indicate that the situation may involve a hate or prejudice crime.</li>
        <li>Depending on the situation, the assigned officers or supervisor may request additional assistance from investigators or other resources to further the investigation.</li>
        <li>The assigned officers will include all available evidence indicating the likelihood of a hate or prejudice crime in the relevant reports. All related reports will be clearly marked as “Hate or Prejudice Crimes” and, absent prior approval of a supervisor, will be completed and submitted by the assigned officers before the end of the shift.</li>
        <li>The assigned officers will provide the victims of any suspected hate or prejudice crime with the brochure on hate and prejudice crimes authorized by the Department. Such brochures will also be available to members of the public upon request. The assigned officers should also make reasonable efforts to assist the victims by providing available information on local assistance programs and organizations as required by the Victim Assistance Policy.</li>
        <li>The assigned officers and supervisor should take reasonable steps to ensure that any such situation does not escalate further and provide information to the victim regarding legal aid, e.g., a possible Temporary Restraining Order through the courts, prosecuting attorney or Prosecuting Attorney.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>338.5 INVESTIGATION DIVISION RESPONSIBILITIES</h3>
    <p>If a case is assigned to the Investigation Division, the assigned investigator will be responsible for following up on the reported hate or prejudice crime as follows:</p>

    </ol>
    <h4>338.5.2 FEDERAL HATE CRIME REPORTING</h4>

            <div class="chapter" id="340">
    <h2>340 - Standards of Conduct</h2>
    <h3>340.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>This policy establishes standards of conduct that are consistent with the values and mission of the Metro Transit Police Department and are expected of all department members. The standards contained in this policy are not intended to be an exhaustive
        list of requirements and prohibitions but they do identify many of the important matters concerning conduct. In addition to the provisions of this policy, members are subject to all other provisions contained in this manual, as well as any additional
        guidance on conduct that may be disseminated by this department or a member’s supervisors.</p>
    <h4>340.1.1 POST</h4>
    <p>This policy incorporates the elements of the Peace Officer Standards and Training Board (POST) Model Policy regarding the professional conduct of peace officers. However, this policy shall apply to all members of this department including volunteer,
        part-time and auxiliary employees.</p>
    <p>The provisions of this policy are in addition to collective bargaining agreements or any other applicable law (see generally Minn. R. 6700.1500).</p>
    <p>The Department shall report annually to POST any data regarding the investigation and disposition of cases involving alleged misconduct of officers (Minn. Stat. § 626.8457, Subd. 3).</p>

    <h3>340.2 POLICY</h3>
    <p>The continued employment or appointment of every member of the Metro Transit Police Department shall be based on conduct that reasonably conforms to the guidelines set forth herein. Failure to meet the guidelines set forth in this policy, whether
        on- or off-duty, may be cause for disciplinary action (see generally Minn. R. 6700.2000 to Minn. R. 6700.2600).</p>

    <h3>340.3 DIRECTIVES AND ORDERS</h3>
    <p>Members shall comply with lawful directives and orders from any department supervisor or person in a position of authority, absent a reasonable and bona fide justification.</p>
    <h4>340.3.1 UNLAWFUL OR CONFLICTING ORDERS</h4>
    <p>Supervisors shall not knowingly issue orders or directives that, if carried out, would result in a violation of any law or department policy. Supervisors should not issue orders that conflict with any previous order without making reasonable clarification
        that the new order is intended to countermand the earlier order.</p>
    <p>No member is required to obey any order that appears to be in direct conflict with any federal law, state law or local ordinance. Following a known unlawful order is not a defense and does not relieve the member from criminal or civil prosecution
        or administrative discipline. If the legality of an order is in doubt, the affected member shall ask the issuing supervisor to clarify the order or shall confer with a higher authority. The responsibility for refusal to obey rests with the member,
        who shall subsequently be required to justify the refusal.</p>
    <p>Unless it would jeopardize the safety of any individual, members who are presented with a lawful order that is in conflict with a previous lawful order, department policy or other directive shall respectfully inform the issuing supervisor of the conflict.
        The issuing supervisor is responsible for either resolving the conflict or clarifying that the lawful order is intended to countermand the previous lawful order or directive, in which case the member is obliged to comply. Members who are compelled
        to follow a conflicting lawful order after having given the issuing supervisor the opportunity to correct the conflict, will not be held accountable for disobedience of the lawful order or directive that was initially issued.</p>
    <p>The person countermanding the original order shall notify, in writing, the person issuing the original order, indicating the action taken and the reason.</p>
    <h4>340.3.2 SUPERVISOR RESPONSIBILITIES</h4>
    <p>Supervisors and managers are required to follow all policies and procedures and may be subject to discipline for:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Failure to be reasonably aware of the performance of their subordinates or to provide appropriate guidance and control.</li>
        <li>Failure to promptly and fully report any known misconduct of a member to his/her immediate supervisor or to document such misconduct appropriately or as required by policy.</li>
        <li>Directing a subordinate to violate a policy or directive, acquiesce to such a violation, or are indifferent to any such violation by a subordinate.</li>
        <li>The unequal or disparate exercise of authority on the part of a supervisor toward any member for malicious or other improper purpose.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>340.4 GENERAL STANDARDS</h3>
    <p>Members shall conduct themselves, whether on- or off-duty, in accordance with the United States and Minnesota Constitutions and all applicable laws, ordinances and rules enacted or established pursuant to legal authority.</p>
    <p>Members shall familiarize themselves with policies and procedures and are responsible for compliance with each. Members should seek clarification and guidance from supervisors in the event of any perceived ambiguity or uncertainty.</p>
    <p>Discipline may be initiated for any good cause. It is not mandatory that a specific policy or rule violation be cited to sustain discipline. This policy is not intended to cover every possible type of misconduct.</p>

    <h3>340.5 CAUSES FOR DISCIPLINE</h3>
    <p>The following are illustrative of causes for disciplinary action. This list is not intended to cover every possible type of misconduct and does not preclude the recommendation of disciplinary action for violation of other rules, standards, ethics

    <p>To reduce the risk of a computer virus or malicious software, members shall not install any unlicensed or unauthorized software on any department computer. Members shall not install personal copies of any software onto any department computer.</p>
    <p>When related to criminal investigations, software program files may be downloaded only with the approval of the information systems technology (IT) staff and with the authorization of the Chief of Police or the authorized designee.</p>
    <p>No member shall knowingly make, acquire or use unauthorized copies of computer software that is not licensed to the Department while on department premises, computer systems or electronic devices. Such unauthorized use of software exposes the Department
        and involved members to severe civil and criminal penalties.</p>
    <p>Introduction of software by members should only occur as part of the automated maintenance or update process of department- or Metropolitan Area-approved or installed programs by the original manufacturer, producer or developer of the software.</p>
    <p>Any other introduction of software requires prior authorization from IT staff and a full scan for malicious attachments.</p>

    <h3>342.6 PROTECTION OF AGENCY SYSTEMS AND FILES</h3>
    <p>All members have a duty to protect the computer system and related systems and devices from physical and environmental damage and are responsible for the correct use, operation, care and maintenance of the computer system.</p>
    <p>Members shall ensure department computers and access terminals are not viewable by persons who are not authorized users. Computers and terminals should be secured, users logged off and password protections enabled whenever the user is not present.
        Access passwords, logon information and other individual security data, protocols and procedures are confidential information and are not to be shared. Password length, format, structure and content shall meet the prescribed standards required
        by the computer system or as directed by a supervisor and shall be changed at intervals as directed by IT staff or a supervisor.</p>
    <p>It is prohibited for a member to allow an unauthorized user to access the computer system at any time or for any reason. Members shall promptly report any unauthorized access to the computer system or suspected intrusion from outside sources (including
        the Internet) to a supervisor.</p>

    <h2>344 - Report Preparation</h2>
    <h3>344.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>Report preparation is a major part of each employee's job. The purpose of reports is to document sufficient information to refresh the employee's memory and to provide sufficient information for follow-up investigation and successful prosecution.
        Report writing is the subject of substantial formalized and on-the-job training.</p>
    <h4>344.1.1 REPORT PREPARATION</h4>
    <p>Employees should ensure that their reports are sufficient for their purpose and reasonably free of errors prior to submission. It is the responsibility of the assigned employee to complete and submit all reports taken during the shift before going
        off-duty, unless permission to hold the report has been approved by a supervisor. Generally, reports requiring prompt follow-up action on active leads, or arrest reports where the suspect remains in custody should not be held.</p>
    <p>Handwritten reports must be prepared legibly. If the report is not legible, the submitting employee will be required by the reviewing supervisor to promptly make corrections and resubmit the report. Employees who dictate reports shall use appropriate
        grammar, as content is not the responsibility of the typist. Employees who generate reports on computers are subject to all requirements of this policy.</p>
    <p>All reports shall accurately reflect the identity of the persons involved, all pertinent information seen, heard or assimilated by any other sense and any actions taken. Employees shall not suppress, conceal or distort the facts of any reported incident
        nor shall any employee make a false report orally or in writing. Generally, the reporting employee's opinions should not be included in reports unless specifically identified as such.</p>

    <h3>344.2 REQUIRED REPORTING</h3>
    <p>Written reports are required in all of the following situations on the appropriate Department- approved form (computerized RMS) unless otherwise approved by a supervisor.</p>
    <h4>344.2.1 CRIMINAL ACTIVITY</h4>
    <p>When a member responds to a call for service, or as a result of self-initiated activity becomes aware of any activity where a crime has occurred, the member shall document the incident regardless of whether a victim desires prosecution.</p>
    <p>Activity to be documented in a written report includes:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>All arrests</li>
        <li>All felony crimes</li>
        <li>All incidents involving violations of crimes or ordinances motivated by bias (Minn. Stat. § 626.5531)</li>
        <li>Non-felony incidents involving threats or stalking behavior</li>
        <li>Situations covered by separate policy. These include:</p>
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>Use of Force Policy</li>
                <li>Domestic Abuse Policy</li>
                <li>Child Abuse Policy</li>
                <li>Adult Abuse Policy</li>
                <li>Hate or Prejudice Crimes Policy</li>
                <li>Suspicious Activity Reports Policy</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>All misdemeanor crimes where the victim desires a report</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Misdemeanor crimes where the victim does not desire a report shall be documented using the department-approved alternative reporting method (e.g., dispatch log).</p>
    <h4>344.2.2 NON-CRIMINAL ACTIVITY</h4>
    <p>The following incidents shall be documented using the appropriate approved report:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Any time an officer points a firearm at any person</li>
        <li>Any use of force against any person by a member of this department (see the Use of Force Policy)</li>
        <li>Any firearm discharge (see the Firearms Policy)</li>
        <li>Any time a person is reported missing, regardless of jurisdiction (see the Missing Persons Policy)</li>
        <li>Any found property or found evidence</li>
        <li>Any traffic collisions above the minimum reporting level (see the Traffic Collisions Policy)</li>
        <li>Suspicious incidents that may indicate a potential for crimes against children or that a child’s safety is in jeopardy</li>
        <li>All protective custody detentions</li>
        <li>Suspicious incidents that may place the public or others at risk</li>
        <li>Whenever the employee believes the circumstances should be documented or at the direction of a supervisor</li>
        <li>Any watercraft collision or accident, drowning death and/or general water accident should be reported on the appropriate Department of Natural Resource Form (Minn. Stat. § 86B.105(a))</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>344.2.3 DEATH REPORTS</h4>
    <p>Reports shall be completed by the handling employee. All deaths shall be handled in compliance with the Death Investigations Policy.</p>
    <h4>344.2.4 INJURY OR DAMAGE BY METROPOLITAN COUNCIL / METRO TRANSIT PERSONNEL</h4>
    <p>Reports shall be taken if an injury occurs that is a result of an act of a Metropolitan Council / Metro Transit employee. Additionally, reports shall be taken involving damage to Metropolitan Council / Metro Transit property or Metropolitan Council
        / Metro Transit equipment if not completed by the local agency having jurisdiction over the case.</p>
    <h4>344.2.5 MISCELLANEOUS INJURIES</h4>
    <p>Any injury that is reported to this department shall require a report when:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>The injury is a result of a drug overdose.</li>
        <li>Attempted suicide.</li>
        <li>The injury is major or serious, whereas death could result.</li>
        <li>The circumstances surrounding the incident are suspicious in nature and it is desirable to record the event.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The above reporting requirements are not intended to be all-inclusive. A supervisor may direct an employee to document any incident he/she deems necessary.</p>
    <h4>344.2.6 ALTERNATE REPORTING FOR VICTIMS</h4>
    <p>Reports that may be submitted by the public via online or other self-completed reporting processes include:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Lost property.</li>
        <li>Misdemeanor thefts of property, other than firearms or materials that threaten public safety, when there is no suspect information or serial number or ability to trace the item.
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>Misdemeanor thefts of cellular telephones may be reported even though they have a serial number.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Misdemeanor vandalism with no suspect information and no hate crime implications.</li>
        <li>Vehicle burglaries with no suspect information or evidence.</li>
        <li>Stolen vehicle attempts with no suspect information or evidence.</li>
        <li>Annoying telephone calls with no suspect information.</li>
        <li>Identity theft without an identifiable suspect.</li>
        <li>Online or email fraud solicitations without an identifiable suspect and if the financial loss classifies the crime as a misdemeanor.</li>
        <li>Hit-and-run vehicle collisions with no suspect or suspect vehicle.</li>
        <li>Supplemental property lists.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Members at the scene of one of the above incidents should not refer the reporting party to an alternate means of reporting without authorization from a supervisor. Members may refer victims to online victim assistance programs (e.g., Federal Communications
        Commission (FCC) website for identity theft, Internet Crime Complaint Center (IC3) website for computer crimes).</p>

    <h3>344.3 OPTIONAL REPORTING / CAD DISPOSITIONS</h3>
    <p>In March 2015, a report writing process was implemented that no longer requires officers to write on all incidents. This process included the new incident status of "<strong>Case Closed No Report Required</strong>."</p>
    <p>If an incident is given a CAD disposition of: "<strong>Citation</strong>", "<strong>Cleared    by Report</strong>", "<strong>Detox</strong>", "<strong>Transport</strong>" or "<strong>Fail to Clear</strong>", the case status will be "<strong>Open</strong>"
        and a written report is required. The other 12 CAD dispositions will have a case disposition of; "<strong>Case Closed No Report Required</strong>." An officer may still write a report on an incident with a status of "<strong>Case Closed No Report Required</strong>"
        if they choose. Once completed, that incident shall have the status changed to "<strong>Supervisor Review</strong>."</p>

    <h3>344.4 GENERAL POLICY OF EXPEDITIOUS REPORTING</h3>
    <p>In general, all employees and supervisors shall act with promptness and efficiency in the preparation and processing of all reports. An incomplete report, unorganized reports or reports delayed without supervisory approval are not acceptable. Reports
        shall be processed according to established priorities or according to special priority necessary under exceptional circumstances.</p>
    <h4>344.4.1 GENERAL POLICY OF HANDWRITTEN REPORTS</h4>
    <p>Some incidents and report forms lend themselves to block print rather than typing. In general, the narrative portion of those reports where an arrest is made or when there is a long narrative should be typed or dictated.</p>
    <p>Supervisors may require, with the foregoing general policy in mind, block printing or typing of reports of any nature for Department consistency.</p>
    <h4>344.4.2 GENERAL USE OF OTHER HANDWRITTEN FORMS</h4>
    <p>County, state and federal agency forms may be block printed as appropriate. In general, the form itself may make the requirement for typing apparent.</p>

    <h3>344.5 REPORT CORRECTIONS</h3>
    <p>Supervisors shall review reports for content and accuracy. If a correction is necessary, the reviewing supervisor shall notify the employee by stating the reasons for rejection. The original report and the corrections needed should be returned to
        the reporting employee for correction as soon as practicable. This will be done by creating a "task" for the employee in the RMS. It shall be the responsibility of the originating employee to ensure that any report returned for correction is processed
        in a timely manner.</p>

    <h3>344.6 REPORT CHANGES OR ALTERATIONS</h3>
    <p>Reports that have been approved by a supervisor and submitted to the Records Section for filing and distribution shall not be modified or altered except by way of a supplemental report. Reviewed reports that have not yet been submitted to the Records
        Section may be corrected or modified by the authoring employee only with the knowledge and authorization of the reviewing supervisor.</p>

    <h3>344.7 ELECTRONIC SIGNATURES</h3>
    <p>The Metro Transit Police Department has established an electronic signature procedure for use by all employees of the Metro Transit Police Department. The Systems Administrator shall be responsible for maintaining the electronic signature system,
        for ensuring that each employee creates a unique, confidential password for his/her electronic signature and that the use of electronic signatures otherwise complies with the law.</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Employees may only use their electronic signature for official reports or other official communications.</li>
        <li>Each employee shall be responsible for the security and use of his/her electronic signature and shall promptly notify a supervisor if the electronic signature has or may have been compromised or misused.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>344.8 FIREARM INJURY REPORTING FROM HEALTH PROFESSIONALS</h3>
    <p>Members receiving a report from a health professional of a bullet or gunshot wound, powder burns or any other injury arising from, or caused by, the discharge of any gun, pistol or any other firearm shall thoroughly investigate the facts surrounding
        the incident (Minn. Stat. § 626.52, Subd. 2; Minn. Stat. § 626.553, Subd. 1).</p>
    <p>The Records Section shall ensure that the report received from the health professional is forwarded to the commissioner of the Department of Health (Minn. Stat. § 626.53, Subd. 2). If the injury resulted from a hunting incident, the Records Section
        shall ensure that the findings of the investigation are forwarded to the commissioner of the Department of Natural Resources using the form provided by the commissioner (Minn. Stat. § 626.553, Subd. 1).</p>

    <h2>346 - Media Relations</h2>
    <h3>346.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>This policy provides guidelines for media releases and media access to scenes of disasters, criminal investigations, emergencies and other law enforcement activities.</p>

    <h3>346.2 RESPONSIBILITIES</h3>
    <p>The ultimate authority and responsibility for the release of information to the media shall remain with the Chief of Police. However, in situations not warranting immediate notice to the Chief of Police and in situations where the Chief of Police
        has given prior approval, Captains, Shift Supervisors and designated Public Information Officer(s) may prepare and release information to the media in accordance with this policy and the applicable law.</p>
    <h4>346.2.1 MEDIA REQUEST</h4>
    <p>Any media request for information or access to a law enforcement situation shall be referred to the designated Department media representative, or if unavailable, to the first available supervisor. Prior to releasing any information to the media,
        employees shall consider the following:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>At no time shall any employee of this department make any comment or release any official information to the media without prior approval from a supervisor or the designated Department media representative.</li>
        <li>In situations involving multiple law enforcement agencies, every reasonable effort should be made to coordinate media releases with the authorized representative of each involved agency prior to the release of any information by this department.</li>
        <li>Under no circumstance should any member of this department make any comment(s) to the media regarding any law enforcement incident not involving this department without prior approval of the Chief of Police.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>346.3 MEDIA ACCESS</h3>
    <p>Authorized members of the media shall be provided access to scenes of disasters, criminal investigations, emergencies and other law enforcement activities subject to the following conditions:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>The media representative shall produce valid press credentials that shall be prominently displayed at all times while in areas otherwise closed to the public.</li>
        <li>Media representatives may be prevented from interfering with emergency operations and criminal investigations.</p>
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>Reasonable effort should be made to provide a safe staging area for the media that is near the incident and that will not interfere with emergency or criminal investigation operations. All information released to the media should be coordinated
                    through the department Public Information Officer or other designated spokesperson.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>No member of this department shall be required to submit to media visits or interviews without the consent of the involved employee.</li>
        <li>Media interviews with individuals who are in custody shall not be permitted unless in compliance with a jail facility policy. Exceptions are only permitted with the approval of the Chief of Police and the express written consent of the person
            in custody.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>A tactical operation should be handled in the same manner as a crime scene, except the news media shall be permitted within the outer perimeter of the scene, subject to any restrictions as determined by the supervisor in charge. Department members
        shall not jeopardize a tactical operation in order to accommodate the news media. All comments to the media shall be coordinated through a supervisor or the Public Information Officer.</p>
    <h4>346.3.1 TEMPORARY FLIGHT RESTRICTIONS</h4>
    <p>Whenever the presence of media or other aircraft poses a threat to public or officer safety or significantly hampers incident operations, the field supervisor should consider requesting a Temporary Flight Restriction (TFR). All requests for a TFR
        should be routed through the Shift Supervisor. The TFR request should include specific information regarding the perimeter and altitude necessary for the incident and should be requested through the appropriate control tower. If the control tower
        is not known, the Federal Aviation Administration should be contacted (14 CFR 91.137).</p>
    <h4>346.3.2 PROVIDING ADVANCE INFORMATION</h4>
    <p>To protect the safety and rights of officers and other persons, advance information about planned actions by law enforcement personnel, such as movement of persons in custody or the execution of an arrest or search warrant, should not be disclosed
        to the news media nor should media representatives be invited to be present at such actions except with the prior approval of the Chief of Police.</p>
    <p>Any exceptions to the above should only be considered for the furtherance of legitimate law enforcement purposes. Prior to approving any exception, the Chief of Police will consider, at minimum, whether the release of information or presence of the
        media would unreasonably endanger any individual, prejudice the rights of any person or is otherwise prohibited by law.</p>

    <h3>346.4 SCOPE OF INFORMATION SUBJECT TO RELEASE</h3>
    <p>The Department will maintain a daily information log of significant law enforcement activities that shall be made available, upon request, to media representatives through the Shift Supervisor. This log will consist of data classified as public and
        should generally contain the following information (Minn. Stat. § 13.82):</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>The date, time, location, case number, type of crime, extent of injury or loss and names of individuals (except confidential informants) involved in crimes occurring within this jurisdiction, unless the release of such information would endanger
            the safety of any individual or jeopardize the successful completion of any ongoing investigation.</li>
        <li>The date, time, location, case number, name, birth date and charges for each person arrested by this department, unless the release of such information would endanger the safety of any individual or jeopardize the successful completion of any
            ongoing investigation.</li>
        <li>The time and location of other significant law enforcement activities or requests for service with a brief summary of the incident subject to the restrictions of this policy and applicable law.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Any requests for copies of related reports or additional information not contained in this log shall be referred to the designated media representative, the custodian of records, or if unavailable, to the Shift Supervisor. Such requests will generally
        be processed in accordance with the provisions of the Minnesota Government Data Practices Act (Minn. Stat. § 13.03).</p>
    <h4>346.4.1 STATE RESTRICTED INFORMATION</h4>
    <p>﻿It shall be the responsibility of the authorized employee dealing with media requests to ensure that restricted information is not inappropriately released to the media by this department (see the Records Maintenance and Release Policy and the Personnel Records Policy). When in doubt, authorized and available legal counsel should be obtained.</p>

    <h3>348.2 POLICY</h3>
    <p>Metro Transit Police Department members will respond appropriately to all subpoenas and any other court-ordered appearances.</p>

    <h3>348.3 SUBPOENAS</h3>
    <p>Only department members authorized to receive a subpoena on behalf of this department or any of its members may do so (Minn. R. Civ. P. 45.02; Minn. R. Crim. P. 22.03).</p>
    <p>A court notice from a prosecutor or other government attorney may be served by delivery to the member’s workstation or mail box. Members shall check for delivery of such documents during each shift worked.</p>
    <p>Subpoenas shall not be accepted in a civil action in which the member or Department is not a party without properly tendered fees pursuant to applicable law (Minn. Stat. § 357.23; Minn. R. Civ. P. 45.03).</p>

    <h3>348.4 FAILURE TO APPEAR</h3>
    <p>Any member who fails to comply with the terms of any properly served subpoena or court-ordered appearance may be subject to discipline. This includes properly served orders to appear that were issued by a state administrative agency.</p>

    <h3>348.5 STANDBY</h3>
    <p>To facilitate standby agreements, members are required to provide and maintain current information on their addresses and contact telephone numbers with the Department.</p>
    <p>If a member on standby changes his/her location during the day, the member shall notify the designated department member of how he/she can be reached. Members are required to remain on standby until released by the court or the party that issued the

															<h2>352 - Outside Agency Assistance</h2>
															<h3>352.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
											                <p>The purpose of this policy is to provide guidance to members when requesting or responding to a request for mutual aid or when assisting another law enforcement agency.</p>

											                <h3>352.2 POLICY</h3>
											                <p>It is the policy of the Metro Transit Police Department to promptly respond to requests for assistance by other law enforcement agencies, subject to available resources and consistent with the applicable laws and policies of this department.</p>

											                <h3>352.3 ASSISTING OUTSIDE AGENCIES</h3>
											                <p>Generally, requests for any type of assistance from another agency should be routed to the Shift Supervisor’s office for approval. Any such response to assist an outside agency may be considered for authorization regardless of whether an agreement for reciprocal aid under Minn. Stat. § 626.76, Subd. 1 exists. In some instances, a memorandum of understanding or other established protocol may exist that eliminates the need for approval of individual requests.</p>
											                <p>When another law enforcement agency requests assistance from this department, the Shift Supervisor may authorize, if available, an appropriate number of personnel to assist. Members are reminded that their actions when rendering assistance must conform with applicable laws and be consistent with the policies of this department.</p>
											                <p>Officers may respond to a request for emergency assistance; however, they shall notify a supervisor of their activity as soon as practicable.</p>
											                <p>Arrestees may be temporarily detained by this department until arrangements for transportation are made by the outside agency. Probation violators who are temporarily detained by this department will not ordinarily be booked by this department. Only in exceptional circumstances, and subject to supervisor approval, will this department provide transportation of arrestees to other facilities on behalf of another agency.</p>
											                <p>When transportation assistance is rendered, a report shall be prepared and submitted by the handling member unless otherwise directed by a supervisor.</p>
									                        <h4>352.3.1 AGREEMENTS</h4>
									                        <p>The Department may, at the discretion of the Chief of Police, establish an agreement with another law enforcement agency to (Minn. Stat. § 626.76, Subd.1):</p>
									                        <ol class="alpha">
									                            <li>Assist other peace officers in the line of their duty and within the course of their employment.</li>
									                            <li>Exchange department peace officers with peace officers of another agency on a temporary basis.</li>
									                        </ol>
									                        <h4>352.3.2 INITIATED ACTIVITY</h4>
														    <p>Any on-duty officer who engages in law enforcement activities of any type that are not part of a mutual aid request and take place outside the jurisdiction of the Metro Transit Police Department shall notify his/her supervisor or the Shift Supervisor and Transit Control Center as soon as practicable. This requirement does not apply to special enforcement details or multi-agency units that regularly work in multiple jurisdictions.</p>

														    <h3>352.4 REQUESTING OUTSIDE ASSISTANCE</h3>
											                <p>If assistance is needed from another agency, the member requesting assistance should, if practicable, first notify a supervisor. The handling member or supervisor should direct assisting personnel to where they are needed and to whom they should report when they arrive.</p>
											                <p>The requesting member should arrange for appropriate radio communication capabilities, if necessary and available, so that communication can be coordinated between assisting personnel.</p>

											                <h3>352.5 REPORTING REQUIREMENTS</h2>
											                <p>Incidents of outside assistance or law enforcement activities that are not documented in a crime report shall be documented in a general case report or as directed by the Shift Supervisor.</p>

											                <h3>352.6 MANDATORY SHARING</h3>
											                <p>Equipment and supplies purchased with federal funds or grants that require such equipment and supplies be shared with other agencies should be documented and updated as necessary by the Administration Supervisor or the authorized designee.</p>

    <h2>360 - Death Investigation</h2>
    <h3>360.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>The investigation of cases involving death include those ranging from natural cause to homicide. Some causes of death may not be readily apparent and some cases differ substantially from what they appeared to be initially. The thoroughness of death
        investigations cannot be emphasized enough.</p>
    <p>Death investigations shall be conducted pursuant to Minn. Stat. § 390.005 through 390.252 if the county has an elected or appointed Coroner (Minn. Stat. § 390.34).</p>

    <h3>360.2 INVESTIGATION CONSIDERATIONS</h3>
    <p>Death investigation cases require certain actions be taken. Emergency Medical Services shall be called in all suspected death cases unless the death is obvious (e.g., decapitated or decomposed). Peace officers are not authorized to pronounce death
        unless they are also Coroners or deputy coroners.</p>
    <p>Metro Transit Police Department officers responding to or encountering a death scene shall promptly notify their Shift Supervisor. The Shift Supervisor shall ensure that a supervisor from the local agency with jurisdiction over the case is also notified.</p>
    <h4>360.2.1 MEDICAL EXAMINER REQUEST</h4>
    <p>The Medical Examiner shall be called in all sudden or unexpected deaths or deaths due to other than natural causes, including, but not limited to (Minn. Stat. § 390.11):</p>

        <li>Unexplained or unexpected perinatal and postpartum maternal deaths.</li>
        <li>Deaths under suspicious, unusual or unexpected circumstances.</li>
        <li>Deaths of persons whose bodies are to be cremated or otherwise disposed of so that the bodies will later be unavailable for examination.</li>
        <li>Deaths of inmates of public institutions and persons in custody of law enforcement officers who have not been hospitalized primarily for organic disease.</li>
        <li>Deaths that occur during, in association with or as the result of diagnostic, therapeutic or anesthetic procedures.</li>
        <li>Deaths due to culpable neglect.</li>
        <li>Stillbirths of 20 weeks or longer gestation unattended by a physician.</li>
        <li>Sudden deaths of persons not affected by recognizable disease.</li>
        <li>Unexpected deaths of persons notwithstanding a history of underlying disease.</li>
        <li>Deaths in which a fracture of a major bone, such as a femur, humerus or tibia, has occurred within the past six months.</li>
        <li>Deaths unattended by a physician occurring outside of a licensed health care facility or licensed residential hospice program.</li>
        <li>Deaths of persons not seen by their physician within 120 days of demise.</li>
        <li>Deaths of persons occurring in an emergency department.</li>
        <li>Stillbirths or deaths of newborn infants in which there has been maternal use of or exposure to unprescribed controlled substances, including street drugs, or in which there is a history or evidence of maternal trauma.</li>

        <li>Solid organ donors.</li>
        <li>Unidentified bodies.</li>
        <li>Skeletonized remains.</li>
        <li>Unexpected deaths occurring within 24 hours of arrival at a health care facility.</li>
        <li>Deaths associated with the decedent's employment.</li>
        <li>Deaths of non-registered hospice patients or patients in non-licensed hospice programs.</li>
        <li>Deaths attributable to acts of terrorism.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>360.2.2 SEARCHING DEAD BODIES</h4>
    <p>The Medical Examiner or his/her assistants and authorized investigators are generally the only persons permitted to move, handle or search a dead body (Minn. Stat. § 390.221).</p>
    <p>An officer shall make a reasonable search of an individual who it is reasonable to believe is dead, or near death, for information identifying the individual as an organ donor or as an individual who made a refusal. If a donor document is located,
        the Medical Examiner shall be promptly notified (Minn. Stat. § 525A.12).</p>
    <p>Should exigent circumstances indicate to an officer that any other search of a known dead body is warranted prior to the arrival of the Medical Examiner, the investigating officer shall first obtain verbal consent from the Medical Examiner.</p>
    <p>The Medical Examiner is required to release property or articles to law enforcement that are necessary for conducting an investigation unless reasonable basis exists pursuant to Minn. Stat.</p>
    <p>§ 390.225 Subd. 2 to not release the property or articles (Minn. Stat. § 390.221).</p>
    <p>Whenever reasonably possible, a witness, preferably a relative of the deceased or a member of the household, should be requested to remain nearby the scene and available to the officer, pending the arrival of the Medical Examiner.</p>
    <p>The name and address of this person shall be included in the narrative of the death report. Whenever personal effects are removed from the body of the deceased by the Medical Examiner, a receipt shall be obtained. This receipt shall be attached to
        the death report.</p>
    <h4>360.2.3 DEATH NOTIFICATION</h4>
    <p>When practicable, and if not handled by the Medical Examiner, notification to the next-of-kin of the deceased person shall be made, in person, by the Chief of Police or designee. If the next-of-kin lives in another jurisdiction, a law enforcement
        official from that jurisdiction may be requested to make the personal notification. If the relatives live outside the Metro Transit Police Department's jurisdiction, the Medical Examiner may be requested to make the notification. The Medical Examiner
        needs to know if notification has been made. Assigned investigators may need to talk to the next-of-kin.</p>
    <p>If a deceased person has been identified as a missing person, this department shall attempt to locate family members and inform them of the death and the location of the deceased missing person's remains. All efforts to locate and notify family members
        shall be recorded in appropriate reports and properly retained (Minn. Stat. § 390.25 Subd. 2 (b)).</p>
    <p>This department shall immediately notify the state fire marshal when a human death results from a fire, (Minn. Stat. § 299F.04 Subd. 5 (b)).</p>
    <h4>360.2.4 UNIDENTIFIED DEAD BODIES</h4>
    <p>If the identity of a dead body cannot be established after the Medical Examiner arrives, the Medical Examiner will issue a "John Doe" or "Jane Doe" number for the report.</p>
    <h4>360.2.5 UNIDENTIFIED BODIES DATA ENTRY</h4>
    <p>As soon as reasonably possible, but no later than 30 working days after the date a death is reported to the Department, any information or items pertaining to identifying features of the unidentified body, dental records, fingerprints, any unusual
        physical characteristics, description of clothing or personal belongings found on or with the body, that are in the possession of MTPD shall be forwarded to the Medical Examiner for transmission to the BCA for eventual entry into systems designed
        to assist in the identification process, such as the Missing Children and Missing Persons Information Clearinghouse and the National Crime Information Center (NCIC) files (Minn. Stat. § 390.25 Subd. 2 (a)).</p>
    <h4>360.2.6 DEATH INVESTIGATION REPORTING</h4>
    <p>All incidents involving a death shall be documented on the appropriate form.</p>
    <h4>360.2.7 SUSPECTED HOMICIDE</h4>
    <p>If the initially assigned officer suspects that the death involves a homicide or other suspicious circumstances, the officer shall take steps to protect the scene and the Investigation Division shall be notified to determine the possible need for
        an investigator to respond to the scene for further immediate investigation.</p>
    <p>If the on-scene supervisor, through consultation with the Shift Supervisor or Investigation Division supervisor, is unable to determine the manner of death, the investigation shall proceed as though it is a homicide.</p>
    <p>The investigator of a homicide or suspicious-circumstances death may, with the approval of his/ her supervisor, request the Medical Examiner to conduct physical examinations and tests and provide a report with the costs borne by the Department (Minn.
        Stat. § 390.251).</p>
    <h4>360.2.8 EMPLOYMENT RELATED DEATHS OR INJURIES</h4>
    <p>Any member of this agency who responds to and determines that a death, serious illness or serious injury has occurred as a result of an accident at or in connection with the victim’s employment, should ensure that the nearest office of the Minnesota
        Department of Labor and Industry is notified with all pertinent information.</p>

    <h2>362 - Identity Theft</h2>
    <h3>362.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>Identity theft is a growing trend that frequently involves related crimes in multiple jurisdictions. This policy is intended to provide guidelines for the reporting and investigation of such crimes.</p>

    <h3>362.2 REPORTING</h3>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>A report shall be taken any time a person living within the jurisdiction of the Metro Transit Police Department reports that he/she has been a victim of identity theft (Minn. Stat. § 609.527, Subd. 5). This includes:
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>Taking a report even if the location of the crime is outside the jurisdiction of this department or has not been determined.</li>
                <li>Providing the victim with department information, as set forth in the Victim and Witness Assistance Policy. Officers should encourage the individual to review the material, and assist with any questions.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Officers should include all known incidents of fraudulent activity (e.g., credit card number applied for in victim’s name when the victim has never made such an application).</li>
        <li>Officers should also cross-reference all known reports made by the victim (e.g., U.S. Secret Service, credit reporting bureaus, U.S. Postal Service and the Department of Public Safety's Driver and Vehicle Services Division) with all known report
            numbers.</li>
        <li>Following supervisory review and Department processing, the initial report should be forwarded to the appropriate investigator for follow-up investigation, coordination with other agencies and prosecution as circumstances dictate.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>362.3 PREVENTATIVE MEASURES</h3>
    <p>The victim should be advised to place a security freeze on his/her consumer report as allowed by law (Minn. Stat. § 13C.016 Subd. 2). A victim may also access the Minnesota Attorney General's office for additional detailed information.</p>

    <h3>362.4 VICTIM DATA</h3>
    <p>The victim may be provided the Consent to Create an FBI Identity Theft File Form and a Notice About Providing Your Social Security Number. These completed forms should be submitted to the Records Section for appropriate filing and entry into the NCIC

    <h2>364 - Private Persons Arrests</h2>
    <h3>364.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this policy is to provide guidance for the handling of private person's arrests made pursuant to Minn. Stat. § 629.30 Subd. 2 (4).</p>

    <h3>364.2 ADVISING PRIVATE PERSONS OF THE ARREST PROCESS</h3>
    <p>All officers shall advise civilians of the right to make a private person's arrest, including advice on how to safely execute such an arrest. In all situations, officers should use sound discretion in determining whether to advise an individual of
        the arrest process.</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>When advising any individual regarding the right to make a private person's arrest, officers should refrain from encouraging or dissuading any individual from making such an arrest and should instead limit advice to the legal requirements for
            such an arrest, as listed below.</li>
        <li>Private individuals should be discouraged from using force to effect a private person's arrest. Absent immediate threat to their own safety or the safety of others, private individuals should be encouraged to refer matters to law enforcement officials
            for further investigation or arrest.</li>
        <li>Private individuals shall be informed of the requirement to take the arrested person before a judge or to a peace officer without unnecessary delay (Minn. Stat. § 629.39).</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>364.3 ARRESTS BY PRIVATE PERSONS</h3>
    <p>A private person may arrest another under the following circumstances (Minn. Stat. § 629.37):</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>For a public offense committed or attempted in his/her presence.</li>
        <li>When the person arrested has committed a felony, although not in his/her presence.</li>
        <li>When a felony has been committed and he/she has reasonable cause for believing the person to be arrested committed the felony.</li>
        <li>When directed by a judge or a peace officer to arrest another person (Minn. Stat. § 629.403).</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>364.4 OFFICER RESPONSIBILITIES</h3>
    <p>Any officer presented with a private person wishing to make an arrest must determine whether there is reasonable cause to believe that such an arrest would be lawful.</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Should any officer determine that there is no reasonable cause to believe that a private person's arrest is lawful, the officer should take no action to further detain or restrain the individual beyond that which reasonably appears necessary to
            investigate the matter, determine the lawfulness of the arrest and protect the public safety.
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>Any officer who determines that a private person's arrest appears to be unlawful should promptly release the arrested individual. The officer must include the basis of such a determination in a related report.</li>
                <li>Absent reasonable cause to support a private person's arrest or other lawful grounds to support an independent arrest by the officer, the officer should advise the parties that no arrest will be made and that the circumstances will be
                    documented in a related report.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Whenever an officer determines that there is reasonable cause to believe that a private person's arrest is lawful, the officer may exercise any of the following options:
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>Take the individual into physical custody for booking.</li>
                <li>Release the individual upon a misdemeanor citation or pending formal charges.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>364.5 REPORTING REQUIREMENTS</h3>
    <p>In all circumstances in which a private person is claiming to have made an arrest, the individual must complete and sign a Department Citizen's Arrest Form. If the person fails or refuses to do so the arrest subject shall be released unless the officer
        has an independent reason to take the person into custody.</p>
    <p>In addition to the Citizen's Arrest Form (and any other related documents, such as citations and booking forms), officers shall complete a narrative report regarding the circumstances and disposition of the incident.</p>

            <div class="chapter" id="368">
    <h2>368 - Limited English Preficiency Services</h2>
    <h3>368.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>This policy provides guidance to members when communicating with individuals with limited English proficiency (LEP) (42 USC § 2000d).</p>
    <h4>368.1.1 DEFINITIONS</h4>
    <p>Definitions related to this policy include:</p>
    <p><strong>Authorized interpreter</strong> - A person who has been screened and authorized by the Department to act as an interpreter and/or translator for others.</p>
    <p><strong>Interpret or interpretation</strong> - The act of listening to a communication in one language (source language) and orally converting it to another language (target language), while retaining the same meaning.</p>
    <p><strong>Limited English proficient (LEP)</strong> - Any individual whose primary language is not English and who has a limited ability to read, write, speak or understand English. These individuals may be competent in certain types of communication
        (e.g., speaking or understanding) but still be LEP for other purposes (e.g., reading or writing). Similarly, LEP designations are context-specific; an individual may possess sufficient English language skills to function in one setting but these
        skills may be insufficient in other situations. This includes individuals who, because of difficulty in speaking or comprehending the English language, cannot fully understand any charges made against them, the seizure of their property, or they
        are incapable of presenting or assisting in the presentation of a defense (Minn. Stat. § 611.31).</p>
    <p><strong>Qualified bilingual member</strong> - A member of the Metro Transit Police Department, designated by the Department, who has the ability to communicate fluently, directly and accurately in both English and another language. Bilingual members
        may be fluent enough to communicate in a non-English language but may not be sufficiently fluent to interpret or translate from one language into another.</p>
    <p><strong>Translate or translation</strong> - The replacement of written text from one language (source language) into an equivalent written text (target language).</p>

    <h3>368.2 POLICY</h3>
    <p>It is the policy of the Metro Transit Police Department to reasonably ensure that LEP individuals have meaningful access to law enforcement services, programs and activities, while not imposing undue burdens on its members.</p>
    <p>The Department will not discriminate against or deny any individual access to services, rights or programs based upon national origin or any other protected interest or right.</p>

    <h3>368.3 LEP COORDINATOR</h3>
    <p>The Chief of Police shall delegate certain responsibilities to an LEP Coordinator. The LEP Coordinator shall be appointed by, and directly responsible to, the Patrol Captain or the authorized designee.</p>
    <p>The responsibilities of the LEP Coordinator include, but are not limited to:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Coordinating and implementing all aspects of the Metro Transit Police Department's LEP services to LEP individuals.</li>
        <li>Developing procedures that will enable members to access LEP services, including telephonic interpreters, and ensuring the procedures are available to all members.</li>
        <li>Ensuring that a list of all qualified bilingual members and authorized interpreters is maintained and available to each Shift Supervisor and Communications Supervisor. The list should include information regarding the following:
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>Languages spoken</li>
                <li>Contact information</li>
                <li>Availability</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Ensuring signage stating that interpreters are available free of charge to LEP individuals is posted in appropriate areas and in the most commonly spoken languages.</li>
        <li>Reviewing existing and newly developed documents to determine which are vital documents and should be translated, and into which languages the documents should be translated.</li>
        <li>Annually assessing demographic data and other resources, including contracted language services utilization data and community-based organizations, to determine if there are additional documents or languages that are appropriate for translation.</li>
        <li>Identifying standards and assessments to be used by the Department to qualify individuals as qualified bilingual members or authorized interpreters.</li>
        <li>Periodically reviewing efforts of the Department in providing meaningful access to LEP individuals, and, as appropriate, developing reports, new procedures or recommending modifications to this policy.</li>
        <li>Receiving and responding to complaints regarding department LEP services.</li>
        <li>Ensuring appropriate processes are in place to provide for the prompt and equitable resolution of complaints and inquiries regarding discrimination in access to department services, programs and activities.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>368.4 FOUR-FACTOR ANALYSIS</h3>
    <p>Since there are many different languages that members could encounter, the Department will utilize the four-factor analysis outlined in the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) Guidance to Federal Financial Assistance Recipients, available at the DOJ
        website, to determine which measures will provide meaningful access to its services and programs. It is recognized that law enforcement contacts and circumstances will vary considerably. This analysis, therefore, must remain flexible and will
        require an ongoing balance of four factors, which are:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>The number or proportion of LEP individuals eligible to be served or likely to be encountered by department members, or who may benefit from programs or services within the jurisdiction of the Department or a particular geographic area.</li>
        <li>The frequency with which LEP individuals are likely to come in contact with department members, programs or services.</li>
        <li>The nature and importance of the contact, program, information or service provided.</li>
        <li>The cost of providing LEP assistance and the resources available.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>368.5 TYPES OF LEP ASSISTANCE AVAILABLE</h3>
    <p>Metro Transit Police Department members should never refuse service to an LEP individual who is requesting assistance, nor should they require an LEP individual to furnish an interpreter as a condition for receiving assistance. The Department will
        make every reasonable effort to provide meaningful and timely assistance to LEP individuals through a variety of services.</p>
    <p>The Department will utilize all reasonably available tools, such as language identification cards, when attempting to determine an LEP individual's primary language.</p>
    <p>LEP individuals may choose to accept department-provided LEP services at no cost or they may choose to provide their own.</p>
    <p>Department-provided LEP services may include, but are not limited to, the assistance methods described in this policy.</p>

    <h3>368.6 WRITTEN FORMS AND GUIDELINES</h3>
    <p>Vital documents or those that are frequently used should be translated into languages most likely to be encountered. The LEP Coordinator will arrange to make these translated documents available to members and other appropriate individuals, as necessary.</p>

    <h3>368.7 AUDIO RECORDINGS</h3>
    <p>The Department may develop audio recordings of important or frequently requested information in a language most likely to be understood by those LEP individuals who are representative of the community being served.</p>

    <h3>368.8 QUALIFIED BILINGUAL MEMBERS</h3>
    <p>Bilingual members may be qualified to provide LEP services when they have demonstrated through established department procedures a sufficient level of skill and competence to fluently communicate in both English and a non-English language. Members
        utilized for LEP services must demonstrate knowledge of the functions of an interpreter/translator and the ethical issues involved when acting as a language conduit. Additionally, bilingual members must be able to communicate technical and law
        enforcement terminology, and be sufficiently proficient in the non-English language to perform complicated tasks, such as conducting interrogations, taking statements, collecting evidence or conveying rights or responsibilities.</p>
    <p>When a qualified bilingual member from this department is not available, personnel from other Metropolitan Area departments, who have been identified by the Department as having the requisite skills and competence, may be requested.</p>

    <h3>368.9 AUTHORIZED INTERPRETERS</h3>
    <p>Any person designated by the Department to act as an authorized interpreter and/or translator must have demonstrated competence in both English and the involved non-English language, must have an understanding of the functions of an interpreter that
        allows for correct and effective translation, and should not be a person with an interest in the department case or investigation involving the LEP individual. A person providing interpretation or translation services may be required to establish
        the accuracy and trustworthiness of the interpretation or translation in a court proceeding.</p>
    <p>Authorized interpreters must pass a screening process established by the LEP Coordinator which demonstrates that their skills and abilities include:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>The competence and ability to communicate information accurately in both English and in the target language.</li>
        <li>Knowledge, in both languages, of any specialized terms or concepts peculiar to this department and of any particularized vocabulary or phraseology used by the LEP individual.</li>
        <li>The ability to understand and adhere to the interpreter role without deviating into other roles, such as counselor or legal adviser.</li>
        <li>Knowledge of the ethical issues involved when acting as a language conduit.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>368.9.1 SOURCES OF AUTHORIZED INTERPRETERS</h4>
    <p>The Department may contract with authorized interpreters who are available over the telephone. Members may use these services with the approval of a supervisor and in compliance with established procedures.</p>
    <p>The Metro Transit Police Department currently contracts with Betmar Languages for communicating with LEP individuals. Betmar Languages may be utilized with the permission of a supervisor and can be contacted at (763) 572-9711 or via their website
        at: <a href="http://www.betmar.com/" target="_blank">www.betmar.com</a></p>
    <p>Metro Transit Police supervisors also have access to RTT Mobile Interpretation which is capable of providing on-demand LEP services through a proprietary device called ELSA (Enabling Language Services Anywhere). Contact a supervisor for assistance
        with this technology. <a href="http://www.rttmobile.com/" target="_blank">www.rttmobile.com</a></p>
    <p>Other sources may include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Qualified bilingual members of this department or personnel from other Metropolitan Council / Metro Transit departments.</li>
        <li>Individuals employed exclusively to perform interpretation services.</li>
        <li>Contracted in-person interpreters, such as state or federal court interpreters, among others.</li>
        <li>Interpreters from other agencies who have been qualified as interpreters by this department, and with whom the Department has a resource-sharing or other arrangement that they will interpret according to department guidelines.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>368.9.2 COMMUNITY VOLUNTEERS AND OTHER SOURCES OF LANGUAGE ASSISTANCE</h4>
    <p>Language assistance may be available from community volunteers who have demonstrated competence in either monolingual (direct) communication and/or in interpretation or translation (as noted in above), and have been approved by the Department to communicate
        with LEP individuals.</p>
    <p>Where qualified bilingual members or other authorized interpreters are unavailable to assist, approved community volunteers who have demonstrated competence may be called upon when appropriate. However, department members must carefully consider the
        nature of the contact and the relationship between the LEP individual and the volunteer to ensure that the volunteer can provide neutral and unbiased assistance.</p>
    <p>While family or friends of an LEP individual may offer to assist with communication or interpretation, members should carefully consider the circumstances before relying on such individuals. For example, children should not be relied upon except in
        exigent or very informal and non-confrontational situations.</p>

    <h3>368.10 CONTACT AND REPORTING</h3>
    <p>While all law enforcement contacts, services and individual rights are important, this department will utilize the four-factor analysis to prioritize service to LEP individuals so that such services may be targeted where they are most needed, according
        to the nature and importance of the particular law enforcement activity involved.</p>
    <p>Whenever any member of this department is required to complete a report or other documentation, and interpretation services are provided to any involved LEP individual, such services should be noted in the related report. Members should document the
        type of interpretation services utilized and whether the individual elected to use services provided by the Department or some other identified source.</p>

    <h3>368.11 RECEIVING AND RESPONDING TO REQUESTS FOR ASSISTANCE</h3>
    <p>The Metro Transit Police Department will take reasonable steps and will work with the Department of Human Resources to develop in-house language capacity by hiring or appointing qualified members proficient in languages representative of the community
        being served.</p>
    <h4>368.11.1 EMERGENCY CALLS TO 9-1-1</h4>
    <p>Department members will make every reasonable effort to promptly accommodate LEP individuals utilizing 9-1-1 lines. When a 9-1-1 call-taker receives a call and determines that the caller is an LEP individual, the call-taker shall quickly determine
        whether sufficient information can be obtained to initiate an appropriate emergency response. If language assistance is still needed, the language is known and a qualified bilingual member is available in Transit Control Center, the call shall
        immediately be handled by the qualified bilingual member.</p>
    <p>If a qualified bilingual member is not available or the call-taker is unable to identify the caller's language, the call-taker will contact the contracted telephone interpretation service and establish a three-way call between the call-taker, the
        LEP individual and the interpreter.</p>
    <p>Dispatchers will make every reasonable effort to dispatch a qualified bilingual member to the assignment, if available and appropriate.</p>
    <p>While 9-1-1 calls shall receive top priority, reasonable efforts should also be made to accommodate LEP individuals seeking routine access to services and information by utilizing the resources listed in this policy.</p>

    <h3>368.12 FIELD ENFORCEMENT</h3>
    <p>Field enforcement will generally include such contacts as traffic stops, pedestrian stops, serving warrants and restraining orders, crowd/traffic control and other routine field contacts that may involve LEP individuals. The scope and nature of these
        activities and contacts will inevitably vary. Members and/or supervisors must assess each situation to determine the need and availability of language assistance to all involved LEP individuals and utilize the methods outlined in this policy to
        provide such assistance.</p>
    <p>Although not every situation can be addressed in this policy, it is important that members are able to effectively communicate the reason for a contact, the need for information and the meaning or consequences of any enforcement action. For example,
        it would be meaningless to request consent to search if the officer is unable to effectively communicate with an LEP individual.</p>
    <p>If available, officers should obtain the assistance of a qualified bilingual member or an authorized interpreter before placing an LEP individual under arrest.</p>

    <h3>368.13 INVESTIGATIVE FIELD INTERVIEWS</h3>
    <p>In any situation where an interview may reveal information that could be used as the basis for arrest or prosecution of an LEP individual and a qualified bilingual member is unavailable or lacks the skills to directly communicate with the LEP individual,
        an authorized interpreter should be used. This includes interviews conducted during an investigation with victims, witnesses and suspects. In such situations, audio recordings of the interviews should be made when reasonably possible. Identification
        and contact information for the interpreter (e.g., name, address) should be documented so that the person can be subpoenaed for trial if necessary.</p>
    <p>If an authorized interpreter is needed, officers should consider calling for an authorized interpreter in the following order:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>An authorized department member or allied agency interpreter</li>
        <li>An authorized telephone interpreter</li>
        <li>Any other authorized interpreter</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Any <em>Miranda</em> warnings shall be provided to suspects in their primary language by an authorized interpreter or, if the suspect is literate, by providing a translated <em>Miranda</em> warning card.</p>
    <p>The use of an LEP individual's bilingual friends, family members, children, neighbors or bystanders may be used only when a qualified bilingual member or authorized interpreter is unavailable and there is an immediate need to interview an LEP individual.</p>

    <h3>368.14 CUSTODIAL INTERROGATIONS</h3>
    <p>Miscommunication during custodial interrogations may have a substantial impact on the evidence presented in a criminal prosecution. Only qualified bilingual members or, if none is available or appropriate, authorized interpreters shall be used during
        custodial interrogations. <em>Miranda</em> warnings shall be provided to suspects in their primary language by the qualified bilingual member or an authorized interpreter.</p>
    <p>In order to ensure that translations during custodial interrogations are accurately documented and are admissible as evidence, interrogations should be recorded whenever reasonably possible. See guidance on recording custodial interrogations in the
        Investigation and Prosecution Policy.</p>
    <h4>368.14.1 OTHER TIMING AND NOTIFICATION MANDATES</h4>
    <p>The investigating or arresting officer shall immediately make necessary contacts to get an authorized interpreter for an in-custody LEP person at the earliest possible time in order to assist the person throughout the interrogation or taking of a
        statement. This applies even when the interrogation will be conducted by a bilingual member (Minn. Stat. § 611.32).</p>
    <p>The following shall be explained to the LEP person with the assistance of the authorized interpreter (Minn. Stat. § 611.32):</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>All charges filed against the person</li>
        <li>All procedures relating to the person's detainment and release</li>
        <li>In the case of any seizure under the provisions of the Asset Forfeiture Policy:
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>The possible consequences of the seizure</li>
                <li>The person's right to judicial review</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>368.14.2 OATH</h4>
    <p>Every authorized interpreter shall be administered and take the following oath prior to assisting in taking a statement related to a criminal matter from an in-custody LEP person (Min. Stat. § 611.33):</p>
    <blockquote>"I will make, to the best of my skill and judgment, a true interpretation to the disabled person being examined of all the proceedings, in a language which said person understands, and to repeat the statements, in the English language, of said person
        to the officials before whom the proceeding is taking place."</blockquote>

    <h3>368.5 BOOKINGS</h3>
    <p>When gathering information during the booking process, members should remain alert to the impediments that language barriers can create. In the interest of the arrestee's health and welfare, the safety and security of the facility, and to protect
        individual rights, it is important that accurate medical screening and booking information be obtained. Members should seek the assistance of a qualified bilingual member whenever there is concern that accurate information cannot be obtained or
        that booking instructions may not be properly understood by an LEP individual.</p>

    <h3>368.16 COMPLAINTS</h3>
    <p>The Department shall ensure that LEP individuals who wish to file a complaint regarding members of this department are able to do so. The Department may provide an authorized interpreter or translated forms, as appropriate. Complaints will be referred
        to the LEP Coordinator.</p>
    <p>Investigations into such complaints shall be handled in accordance with the Personnel Complaints Policy. Authorized interpreters used for any interview with an LEP individual during an investigation should not be members of this department.</p>
    <p>Any notice required to be sent to an LEP individual as a complaining party pursuant to the Personnel Complaints Policy should be translated or otherwise communicated in a language- accessible manner.</p>

    <h3>368.17 COMMUNITY OUTREACH</h3>
    <p>Community outreach programs and other such services offered by this department are important to the ultimate success of more traditional law enforcement duties. This department will continue to work with community groups, local businesses and neighborhoods
        to provide equal access to such programs and services.</p>

    <h3>368.18 TRAINING</h3>
    <p>To ensure that all members who may have contact with LEP individuals are properly trained, the Department will provide periodic training on this policy and related procedures, including how to access department-authorized telephonic and in-person
        interpreters and other available resources.</p>
    <p>The Training Coordinator shall be responsible for ensuring new members receive LEP training. Those who may have contact with LEP individuals should receive refresher training at least once every two years thereafter. The Training Supervisor shall
        maintain records of all LEP training provided, and will retain a copy in each member's training file in accordance with established records retention schedules.</p>
    <h4>368.18.1 TRAINING FOR AUTHORIZED INTERPRETERS</h4>
    <p>All members on the authorized interpreter list must successfully complete prescribed interpreter training. To complete interpreter training successfully, an interpreter must demonstrate proficiency in and ability to communicate information accurately
        in both English and in the target language, demonstrate knowledge in both languages of any specialized terms or phraseology, and understand and adhere to the interpreter role without deviating into other roles, such as counselor or legal adviser.</p>
    <p>Members on the authorized interpreter list must receive refresher training annually or they will be removed from the authorized interpreter list. This annual training should include language skills competency (including specialized terminology) and
        ethical considerations.</p>
    <p>The Training Supervisor shall be responsible for coordinating the annual refresher training and will maintain a record of all training the interpreters have received.</p>

    <h2>370 - Communications with Persons with Disabilities</h2>
    <h3>370.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>This policy provides guidance to members when communicating with individuals with disabilities, including those who are deaf or hard of hearing, have impaired speech or vision, or are blind.</p>
    <h4>370.1.1 DEFINITIONS</h4>
    <p>Definitions related to this policy include:</p>
    <p><strong>Auxiliary aids</strong> - Tools used to communicate with people who have a disability or impairment. They include, but are not limited to, the use of gestures or visual aids to supplement oral communication; a notepad and pen or pencil to
        exchange written notes; a computer or typewriter; an assistive listening system or device to amplify sound; a teletypewriter (TTY) or videophones (video relay service or VRS); taped text; qualified readers; or a qualified interpreter.</p>
    <p><strong>Disability or impairment</strong> - A physical or mental impairment that substantially limits a major life activity, including hearing or seeing, regardless of whether the disabled person uses assistive or adaptive devices or auxiliary aids.
        Individuals who wear ordinary eyeglasses or contact lenses are not considered to have a disability (42 USC § 12102). This includes those who, because of a hearing, speech or other communication disorder, cannot fully understand any charges made
        against them, the seizure of their property or they are incapable of presenting or assisting in the presentation of a defense (Minn. Stat. § 611.31).</p>
    <p><strong>Qualified Interpreter</strong> - A person who is able to interpret effectively, accurately and impartially, both receptively and expressively, using any necessary specialized vocabulary. Qualified interpreters include oral interpreters, transliterators,
        sign language interpreters and intermediary interpreters.</p>

    <h3>370.2 POLICY</h3>
    <p>It is the policy of the Metro Transit Police Department to reasonably ensure that people with disabilities, including victims, witnesses, suspects and arrestees have equal access to law enforcement services, programs and activities. Members must make
        efforts to communicate effectively with individuals with disabilities.</p>
    <p>The Department will not discriminate against or deny any individual access to services, rights or programs based upon disabilities.</p>

    <h3>370.3 AMERICANS WITH DISABILITIES (ADA) COORDINATOR</h3>
    <p>The Chief of Police shall delegate certain responsibilities to an ADA Coordinator (28 CFR 35.107). The ADA Coordinator shall be appointed by and directly responsible to the Patrol Captain or the authorized designee.</p>
    <p>The responsibilities of the ADA Coordinator shall include, but not be limited to:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Working with the Metropolitan Council / Metro Transit ADA coordinator regarding the Metro Transit Police Department's efforts to ensure equal access to services, programs and activities.</li>
        <li>Developing reports, new procedures, or recommending modifications to this policy.</li>
        <li>Acting as a liaison with local disability advocacy groups or other disability groups regarding access to department services, programs and activities.</li>
        <li>Ensuring that a list of qualified interpreter services is maintained and available to each Shift Supervisor and Communications Supervisor. The list should include information regarding the following:
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>Contact information</li>
                <li>Availability</li>
                <li>Type of services provided</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Developing procedures that will enable members to access auxiliary aids or services, including qualified interpreters, and ensure the procedures are available to all members.</li>
        <li>Ensuring signage is posted in appropriate areas, indicating that auxiliary aids are available free of charge to people with disabilities.</li>
        <li>Ensuring appropriate processes are in place to provide for the prompt and equitable resolution of complaints and inquiries regarding discrimination in access to department services, programs and activities.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>370.4 FACTORS TO CONSIDER</h3>
    <p>Because the nature of any law enforcement contact may vary substantially from one situation to the next, members of this department should consider all information reasonably available to them when determining how to communicate with an individual
        with a disability. Members should carefully balance all known factors in an effort to reasonably ensure people who are disabled have equal access to services, programs and activities. These factors may include, but are not limited to:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Members should not always assume that effective communication is being achieved. The fact that an individual appears to be nodding in agreement does not always mean he/she completely understands the message. When there is any doubt, members should
            ask the individual to communicate back or otherwise demonstrate their understanding.</li>
        <li>The nature of the disability (e.g., deafness or blindness vs. hard of hearing or low vision).</li>
        <li>The nature of the law enforcement contact (e.g., emergency vs. non-emergency, custodial vs. consensual contact).</li>
        <li>The availability of auxiliary aids. The fact that a particular aid is not available does not eliminate the obligation to reasonably ensure access. However in an emergency availability may factor into the type of aid used.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>370.5 INITIAL AND IMMEDIATE CONSIDERATIONS</h3>
    <p>Recognizing that various law enforcement encounters may be potentially volatile and/or emotionally charged, members should remain alert to the possibility of communication problems.</p>
    <p>Members should exercise special care in the use of all gestures and verbal and written communication to minimize initial confusion and misunderstanding when dealing with any individual with known or suspected disabilities.</p>
    <p>In a non-emergency situation when a member knows or suspects an individual requires assistance to effectively communicate the member shall identify the individual's choice of auxiliary aid or service.</p>
    <p>The individual's preferred communication method must be honored unless another effective method of communication exists under the circumstances (28 CFR 35.160).</p>
    <p>Factors to consider when determining whether an alternative method is effective include:</p>
    <ol class="">
        <li>The methods of communication usually used by the individual.</li>
        <li>The nature, length and complexity of the communication involved.</li>
        <li>The context of the communication.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>In emergency situations involving an imminent threat to the safety or welfare of any person, members may use whatever auxiliary aids and services that reasonably appear effective under the circumstances. This may include for example exchanging written
        notes or using the services of a person who knows sign language but is not a qualified interpreter even if the person who is deaf or hard of hearing would prefer a qualified sign language interpreter or another appropriate auxiliary aid or service.
        Once the emergency has ended the continued method of communication should be reconsidered. The member should inquire as to the individual's preference and give primary consideration to that preference.</p>
    <p>If an individual who is deaf, hard of hearing or has impaired speech must be handcuffed while in the custody of the Metro Transit Police Department, consideration should be given, safety permitting, to placing the handcuffs in the front of the body
        to facilitate communication using sign language or writing.</p>

    <h3>370.6 TYPES OF ASSISTANCE AVAILABLE</h3>
    <p>Metro Transit Police Department members shall never refuse to assist an individual with disabilities who is requesting assistance. The Department will not charge anyone to receive auxiliary aids, nor shall they require anyone to furnish their own
        auxiliary aid or service as a condition for receiving assistance. The Department will make every reasonable effort to provide equal access and timely assistance to individuals who are disabled through a variety of services.</p>
    <p>A person who is disabled may choose to accept department-provided auxiliary aids or services or they may choose to provide their own.</p>
    <p>Department-provided auxiliary aids or services may include, but are not limited to, the assistance methods described in this policy.</p>

    <h3>370.7 AUDIO RECORDINGS AND ENLARGED PRINT</h3>
    <p>The Department may develop audio recordings to assist people who are blind or have a visual impairment with accessing important information. If such a recording is not available, members may read aloud from the appropriate form, for example a personnel
        complaint form, or provide forms with enlarged print.</p>

    <h3>370.8 QUALIFIED INTERPRETERS</h3>
    <p>A qualified interpreter may be needed in lengthy or complex transactions (e.g., interviewing a victim, witness, suspect or arrestee), if the individual to be interviewed normally relies on sign language or speechreading (lip-reading) to understand
        what others are saying. The qualified interpreter should not be a person with an interest in the case or the investigation. A person providing interpretation services may be required to establish the accuracy and trustworthiness of the interpretation
        in a court proceeding.</p>
    <p>Qualified interpreters should be:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Available by some means, even remotely, within a reasonable amount of time but in no event longer than one hour if requested.</li>
        <li>Experienced in providing interpretation services related to law enforcement matters.</li>
        <li>Familiar with the use of VRS and/or video remote interpreting services.</li>
        <li>Certified in either American Sign Language (ASL) or Signed English (SE).</li>
        <li>Able to understand and adhere to the interpreter role without deviating into other roles, such as counselor or legal adviser.</li>
        <li>Knowledgeable of the ethical issues involved when providing interpreter services.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Members should use department-approved procedures to request a qualified interpreter at the earliest reasonable opportunity and generally not more than 15 minutes after a request for an interpreter has been made or it is reasonably apparent that an
        interpreter is needed. No individual who is disabled shall be required to provide his/her own interpreter (28 CFR 35.160).</p>

    <h3>370.9 TTY AND RELAY SERVICES</h3>
    <p>In situations where an individual without a disability would have access to a telephone (e.g., booking or attorney contacts), members must also provide those who are deaf, hard of hearing or have impaired speech the opportunity to place calls using
        an available TTY (also known as a telecommunications device for deaf people, or TDD). Members shall provide additional time as needed for effective communication due to the slower nature of TTY and TDD communications.</p>
    <p>The Department will accept all TTY or TDD calls placed by those who are deaf or hard of hearing and received via a telecommunications relay service (28 CFR 35.162).</p>
    <p>Note that relay services translate verbatim, so the conversation must be conducted as if speaking directly to the caller.</p>

    <h3>370.10 COMMUNITY VOLUNTEERS</h3>
    <p>Interpreter services may be available from community volunteers who have demonstrated competence in communication services such as ASL or SE, and have been approved by the Department to provide interpreter services.</p>
    <p>Where qualified interpreters are unavailable to assist approved community volunteers who have demonstrated competence may be called upon when appropriate. However department members must carefully consider the nature of the contact and the relationship
        between the individual with the disability and the volunteer to ensure that the volunteer can provide neutral and unbiased assistance.</p>

    <h3>370.11 FAMILY AND FRIENDS</h3>
    <p>While family or friends may offer to assist with interpretation, members should carefully consider the circumstances before relying on such individuals. The nature of the contact and relationship between the individual with the disability and the
        person offering services must be carefully considered (e.g., victim/suspect).</p>
    <p>Children shall not be relied upon except in emergency or critical situations when there is no qualified interpreter reasonably available.</p>
    <p>Adults may be relied upon when (28 CFR 35.160):</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>There is an emergency or critical situation and there is no qualified interpreter reasonably available.</li>
        <li>The person with the disability requests that the adult interpret or facilitate communication and the adult agrees to provide such assistance, and reliance on that adult for such assistance is reasonable under the circumstances.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>370.12 REPORTING</h3>
    <p>Whenever any member of this department is required to complete a report or other documentation and communication assistance has been provided, such services should be noted in the related report. Members should document the type of communication services
        utilized and whether the individual elected to use services provided by the Department or some other identified source. If the individual's express preference is not honored, the member must document why another method of communication was used.</p>
    <p>All written communications exchanged in a criminal case shall be attached to the report or placed into evidence.</p>

    <h3>370.13 FIELD ENFORCEMENT</h3>
    <p>Field enforcement will generally include such contacts as traffic stops, pedestrian stops, serving warrants and restraining orders, crowd/traffic control and other routine field contacts that may involve individuals with disabilities. The scope and
        nature of these activities and contacts will inevitably vary.</p>
    <p>The Department recognizes it would be virtually impossible to provide immediate access to complete communication services to every member of this department. Members and/or supervisors must assess each situation and consider the length, complexity
        and importance of the communication, as well as the individual's preferred method of communication, when determining the type of resources to use and whether a qualified interpreter is needed.</p>
    <p>Although not every situation can be addressed in this policy, it is important that members are able to effectively communicate the reason for a contact, the need for information and the meaning or consequences of any enforcement action. For example
        it would be meaningless to verbally request consent to search if the officer is unable to effectively communicate with an individual who is deaf or hard of hearing and requires communications assistance.</p>
    <p>If available, officers should obtain the assistance of a qualified interpreter before placing an individual with a disability under arrest. Individuals who are arrested and are assisted by service animals should be permitted to make arrangements for
        the care of such animals prior to transport.</p>
    <h4>370.13.1 FIELD RESOURCES</h4>
    <p>Examples of methods that may be sufficient for transactions such as checking a license or giving directions to a location or for urgent situations such as responding to a violent crime in progress may, depending on the circumstances, include such
        simple things as:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Hand gestures or visual aids with an individual who is deaf, hard of hearing or has impaired speech.</li>
        <li>Exchange of written notes or communications.</li>
        <li>Verbal communication with an individual who can speechread by facing the individual and speaking slowly and clearly.</li>
        <li>Use of computer, word processing, personal communication device or similar device to exchange texts or notes.</li>
        <li>Slowly and clearly speaking or reading simple terms to individuals who have a visual or mental impairment.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Members should be aware that these techniques may not provide effective communication as required by law and this policy depending on the circumstances.</p>

    <h3>370.14 CUSTODIAL INTERROGATIONS</h3>
    <p>In an effort to ensure the rights of individuals who are deaf, hard of hearing or have speech impairment are protected during a custodial interrogation, this department will provide interpreter services before beginning an interrogation, unless exigent
        circumstances exist. The use of a video remote interpreting service should be considered, where appropriate, if a live interpreter is not available. <em>Miranda</em> warnings shall be provided to suspects who are deaf or hard of hearing by a qualified
        interpreter or by providing a written <em>Miranda</em> warning card.</p>
    <p>To ensure that communications during custodial investigations are accurately documented and are admissible as evidence, as with all custodial interviews, interrogations should be recorded whenever reasonably possible. See guidance on recording custodial
        interrogations in the Investigation and Prosecution Policy.</p>
    <h4>370.14.1 OTHER TIMING AND NOTIFICATION MANDATES</h4>
    <p>The investigating or arresting officer shall immediately make necessary contacts to get a qualified interpreter for a person in custody at the earliest possible time (Minn. Stat. § 611.32).</p>
    <p>The following shall be explained with the assistance of the qualified interpreter (Minn. Stat. § 611.32):</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>All charges filed against the person</li>
        <li>All procedures relating to the person's detainment and release</li>
        <li>In the case of any seizure under the Asset Forfeiture Policy:
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>The possible consequences of the seizure</li>
                <li>The person's right to judicial review</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>370.14.2 OATH</h4>
    <p>Every qualified interpreter shall be administered and take the following oath prior to assisting in taking a statement related to a criminal matter from an in-custody deaf or hard of hearing person (Minn. Stat. § 611.33):</p>
    <p>"I will make, to the best of my skill and judgment, a true interpretation to the disabled person being examined of all the proceedings, in a language which said person understands, and to repeat the statements, in the English language, of said person
        to the officials before whom the proceeding is taking place."</p>

    <h3>370.15 ARRESTS AND BOOKINGS</h3>
    <p>If an individual with speech or hearing disabilities is arrested, the arresting officer shall use department-approved procedures to provide a qualified interpreter at the place of arrest or booking as soon as reasonably practicable, unless the individual
        indicates that he/she prefers a different auxiliary aid or service or the officer reasonably determines another effective method of communication exists under the circumstances.</p>
    <p>When gathering information during the booking process members should remain alert to the impediments that often exist when communicating with those who are deaf, hard of hearing, who have impaired speech or vision, are blind, or have other disabilities.
        In the interest of the arrestee's health and welfare, the safety and security of the facility and to protect individual rights, it is important that accurate medical screening and booking information be obtained. If necessary, members should seek
        the assistance of a qualified interpreter whenever there is concern that accurate information cannot be obtained or that booking instructions may not be properly understood by the individual.</p>
    <p>Individuals who require and possess personally owned communication aids (e.g., hearing aids, cochlear processors) should be permitted to retain them while in custody.</p>

    <h3>370.16 COMPLAINTS</h3>
    <p>The Department shall ensure that individuals with disabilities who wish to file a complaint regarding members of this department are able to do so. The Department may provide a qualified interpreter or forms in enlarged print, as appropriate. Complaints
        will be referred to the department ADA Coordinator.</p>
    <p>Investigations into such complaints shall be handled in accordance with the Personnel Complaints Policy. Qualified interpreters used during the investigation of a complaint should not be members of this Department.</p>

    <h3>370.17 COMMUNITY OUTREACH</h3>
    <p>Community outreach programs and other such services offered by this department are important to the ultimate success of more traditional law enforcement duties. This department will continue to work with community groups, local businesses and neighborhoods
        to provide equal access to such programs and services.</p>

    <h3>370.18 TRAINING</h3>
    <p>To ensure that all members who may have contact with individuals who are disabled are properly trained, the Department will provide periodic training that should include:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Awareness and understanding of this policy and related procedures, related forms and available resources.</li>
        <li>Procedures for accessing qualified interpreters and other available resources.</li>
        <li>Working with in-person and telephone interpreters and related equipment.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The Training Coordinator shall be responsible for ensuring new members receive training related to interacting with individuals who have disabilities, including individuals who are deaf, hard of hearing, who have impaired speech or vision, or are
        blind. Those who may have contact with such individuals should receive refresher training at least once every two years thereafter. The Training Coordinator shall maintain records of all training provided, and will retain a copy in each member's
        training file in accordance with established records retention schedules.</p>
    <h4>370.18.1 CALL-TAKER TRAINING</h4>
    <p>Emergency call-takers shall be trained in the use of TTY equipment protocols for communicating with individuals who are deaf, hard of hearing or who have speech impairments. Such training and information should include:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>The requirements of the ADA and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act for telephone emergency service providers.</li>
        <li>ASL syntax and accepted abbreviations.</li>
        <li>Practical instruction on identifying and processing TTY or TDD calls, including the importance of recognizing silent TTY or TDD calls, using proper syntax, abbreviations and protocol when responding to TTY or TDD calls.</li>
        <li>Hands-on experience in TTY and TDD communications, including identification of TTY or TDD tones.</li>

    <h2>373 - Pupil Arrest Reporting</h2>
    <h3>373.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this policy is to describe the procedures to follow when a pupil is arrested on school grounds and during school hours.</p>

    <h3>373.2 PUPIL ARREST REPORTING</h3>
    <p>In the event a school pupil is arrested, the arresting officer shall include the necessary information in the report to ensure that the Records Division notifies the chief administrative officer of the school, or an appropriate designee, of the pupil's
        arrest.</p>
    <p>If there is probable cause to believe an incident involved alcohol or a controlled substance, the arresting officer shall complete the appropriate form and submit the form with the report to the Records Division. The Records Division shall ensure
        the form is distributed to the chemical abuse pre-assessment team of the school within two weeks of the occurrence (Minn. Stat. § 121A.28).</p>
    <p>Arrest reporting may involve the officer, Investigative Division and/or the local agency having jurisdiction over the case.</p>
    <h4>373.2.1 PUPIL ARREST AFTER NOTIFICATION</h4>
    <p>Based upon the circumstances of the investigation, it may be appropriate to notify the school prior to the arrest. Prior notification and assistance from the school, may reduce disruption to school operations and other students.</p>
    <p><br></p>
    <h4>373.2.2 PUPIL ARREST BEFORE NOTIFICATION</h4>
    <p>Based upon the circumstances of the investigation, it may be appropriate to arrest the pupil before notifying the school. This may be appropriate if the pupil is a flight risk, if prior notification will impede the investigation or if notification
        creates additional risks to students, faculty, the officer or the public.</p>
    <p>Proper notification to the school after the pupil's arrest should then be made when circumstances reasonably allow.</p>
    <h4>373.2.3 PARENTAL NOTIFICATION</h4>
    <p>Upon arrest, it is the arresting officer's responsibility to ensure the parents of the arrested pupil are properly notified. Notification shall be made by the officer, regardless of subsequent notifications by the juvenile detention facility. Notifications
        should be documented and include the charges against the pupil and where the pupil will be taken.</p>

    <h2>374 - Biological Samples</h2>
    <h3>374.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>This policy provides guidelines for the collection of biological samples from those individuals required to provide samples upon conviction for certain offenses. This policy does not apply to biological samples collected at a crime scene or taken
        from a person in conjunction with a criminal investigation. Nor does it apply to biological samples collected from those required to register, for example, as sex offenders.</p>

    <h3>374.2 POLICY</h3>
    <p>The Metro Transit Police Department will assist in the expeditious collection of required biological samples from offenders in accordance with the laws of this state and with as little reliance on force as practicable.</p>

    <h3>374.3 PERSONS SUBJECT TO BIOLOGICAL SAMPLE COLLECTION</h3>
    <p>The following persons must submit a biological sample:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Adults who are subject to a court order requiring a biological sample after sentencing (Minn. Stat. § 609.117).</li>
        <li>Juveniles who are subject to a court order requiring a biological sample after being adjudicated delinquent (Minn. Stat. § 609.117).</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>374.4 PROCEDURE</h3>
    <p>When an individual is required to provide a biological sample, a qualified employee shall attempt to obtain the sample in accordance with this policy.</p>
    <h4>374.4.1 COLLECTION</h4>
    <p>The following steps should be taken to collect a sample:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Verify that the individual is required to provide a sample pursuant to Minn. Stat. § 609.117.</li>
        <li>Verify that a biological sample has not been previously collected from the offender by querying the person’s criminal history. There is no need to obtain a biological sample if one has been previously obtained.</li>
        <li>Use the designated collection kit provided by the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension to perform the collection and take steps to avoid cross contamination.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>374.5 USE OF FORCE TO OBTAIN SAMPLES</h3>
    <p>If a person refuses to cooperate with the sample collection process, officers should attempt to identify the reason for refusal and seek voluntary compliance without resorting to using force. Force will not be used in the collection of samples except
        as authorized by court order or approval of legal counsel and only with the approval of a supervisor. Methods to consider when seeking voluntary compliance include contacting:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>The person’s parole or probation officer when applicable.</li>
        <li>The prosecuting attorney to seek additional charges against the person for failure to comply or to otherwise bring the refusal before a judge.</li>
        <li>The judge at the person’s next court appearance.</li>
        <li>The person’s attorney.</li>
        <li>A chaplain.</li>
        <li>Another custody facility with additional resources, where an arrestee can be transferred to better facilitate sample collection.</li>
        <li>A supervisor who may be able to authorize custodial disciplinary actions to compel compliance, if any are available.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The supervisor shall review and approve any plan to use force and be present to document the process.</p>
    <h4>374.5.1 VIDEO RECORDING</h4>
    <p>A video recording should be made any time force is used to obtain a biological sample. The recording should document all staff participating in the process, in addition to the methods and all force used during the collection. The recording should
        be part of the investigation file, if any, or otherwise retained in accordance with the department’s records retention schedule.</p>

    <h2>378 - Public Safety Video Surveillance System</h2>
    <h3>378.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>This policy provides guidance for the placement and monitoring of department public safety video surveillance, as well as the storage and release of the captured images.</p>
    <p>This policy only applies to overt, marked public safety video surveillance systems operated by the Department. It does not apply to mobile audio/video systems, covert audio/video systems or any other image capturing devices used by the Department.</p>

    <h3>378.2 POLICY</h3>
    <p>The Metro Transit Police Department operates a public safety video surveillance system to complement its anti-crime strategy, to effectively allocate and deploy personnel, and to enhance public safety and security in public areas. Cameras may be placed
        in strategic locations throughout the Metropolitan Council / Metro Transit service area to detect and deter crime, to help safeguard against potential threats to the public, to help manage emergency response situations during natural and man-made
        disasters and to assist Metropolitan Council / Metro Transit officials in providing services to the community.</p>
    <p>Video surveillance in public areas will be conducted in a legal and ethical manner while recognizing and protecting constitutional standards of privacy.</p>

    <h3>378.3 VIDEO SURVEILLANCE AUDIT</h3>
    <p>The Chief of Police or the authorized designee will conduct an annual review of the public safety video surveillance system. The review should include an analysis of the cost, benefit and effectiveness of the system, including any public safety issues
        that were effectively addressed or any significant prosecutions that resulted, and any systemic operational or administrative issues that were identified, including those related to training, discipline or policy.</p>
    <p>The results of each review shall be appropriately documented and maintained by the Chief of Police or the authorized designee and other applicable advisory bodies. Any recommendations for training or policy should be promptly addressed.</p>

    <h3>378.4 TRAINING</h3>
    <p>All department members authorized to operate or access public video surveillance systems shall receive appropriate training. Training should include guidance on the use of cameras, interaction with dispatch and patrol operations and a review regarding
        relevant policies and procedures, including this policy. Training should also address state and federal law related to the use of video surveillance equipment and privacy.</p>

    <h3>378.5 OPERATIONAL GUIDELINES</h3>
    <p>Only department-approved video surveillance equipment shall be utilized. Members authorized to monitor video surveillance equipment should only monitor public areas and public activities where</p>
    <p>no reasonable expectation of privacy exists. The Chief of Police or the authorized designee shall approve all proposed locations for the use of video surveillance technology and should consult with and be guided by legal counsel as necessary in making
        such determinations.</p>
    <h4>378.5.1 INTEGRATION WITH OTHER TECHNOLOGY</h4>
    <p>The Department may elect to integrate its public safety video surveillance system with other technology to enhance available information. Systems such as gunshot detection, incident mapping, crime analysis, license plate recognition, facial recognition
        and other video-based analytical systems may be considered based upon availability and the nature of department strategy.</p>
    <p>The Department should evaluate the availability and propriety of networking or otherwise collaborating with appropriate private sector entities and should evaluate whether the use of certain camera systems, such as pan-tilt-zoom systems and video
        enhancement or other analytical technology, requires additional safeguards.</p>
    <h4>378.5.2 CAMERA MARKINGS</h4>
    <p>All public areas monitored by public safety surveillance equipment shall be marked in a conspicuous manner with appropriate signs to inform the public that the area is under police surveillance. Signs should be well lit, placed appropriately and without
        obstruction to ensure visibility.</p>
    <h4>378.5.3 PLACEMENT AND MONITORING</h4>
    <p>Camera placement will be guided by the underlying purpose or strategy associated with the overall video surveillance plan. As appropriate, the Chief of Police should confer with other affected Metropolitan Council / Metro Transit divisions and designated
        community groups when evaluating camera placement. Environmental factors, including lighting, location of buildings, presence of vegetation or other obstructions, should also be evaluated when determining placement.</p>
    <p>Recorded images may be used for a variety of purposes, including criminal investigations and monitoring of activity around high-value or high-threat areas. The public safety video surveillance system may be useful for the following purposes:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>To prevent, deter and identify criminal activity.</li>
        <li>To target identified areas of gang and narcotics complaints or activity.</li>
        <li>To respond to critical incidents.</li>
        <li>To assist in identifying, apprehending and prosecuting offenders.</li>
        <li>To document officer and offender conduct during interactions to safeguard the rights of the public and officers.</li>
        <li>To augment resources in a cost-effective manner.</li>
        <li>To monitor pedestrian and vehicle traffic activity.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Images from each camera should be recorded in a manner consistent with the underlying purpose of the particular camera. Images may be transmitted to monitors installed in the Shift Supervisor’s office and Transit Control Center. When activity warranting
        further investigation is reported or detected at any camera location, the available information should be provided to responding officers in a timely manner. The Shift Supervisor or trained Transit Control Center personnel are authorized to adjust
        the cameras to more effectively view a particular area for any legitimate public safety purpose.</p>
    <p>The Chief of Police may authorize video feeds from the public safety video surveillance system to be forwarded to a specified location for monitoring by other than police personnel, such as allied government agencies, road or traffic crews, or fire
        or emergency operations personnel.</p>
    <p>Unauthorized recording, viewing, reproduction, dissemination or retention is prohibited.</p>

    <h3>378.6 STORAGE AND RETENTION OF MEDIA</h3>
    <p>All downloaded media shall be stored in a secure area with access restricted to authorized persons. A recording needed as evidence shall be copied to a suitable medium and booked into evidence in accordance with established evidence procedures. All
        actions taken with respect to retention of media shall be appropriately documented.</p>
    <p>The type of video surveillance technology employed and the manner in which recordings are used and stored will affect retention periods. The recordings should be stored and retained in accordance with the established records retention schedule.</p>
    <h4>378.6.1 EVIDENTIARY INTEGRITY</h4>
    <p>All downloaded and retained media shall be treated in the same manner as other evidence. Media shall be accessed, maintained, stored and retrieved in a manner that ensures its integrity as evidence, including strict adherence to chain of custody requirements.
        Electronic trails, including encryption, digital masking of innocent or uninvolved individuals to preserve anonymity, authenticity certificates and date and time stamping shall be used as appropriate to preserve individual rights and to ensure
        the authenticity and maintenance of a secure evidentiary chain of custody.</p>

    <h3>378.7 VIDEO SUPERVISION</h3>
    <p>Supervisors should monitor video surveillance access and usage to ensure members are within department policy and applicable laws. Supervisors should ensure such use and access is appropriately documented.</p>
    <h4>378.7.1 PROHIBITED ACTIVITY</h4>
    <p>Public safety video surveillance systems will not intentionally be used to invade the privacy of individuals or observe areas where a reasonable expectation of privacy exists.</p>
    <p>Public video surveillance equipment shall not be used in an unequal or discriminatory manner and shall not target protected individual characteristics including, but not limited to race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, disability, gender or
        sexual orientation.</p>
    <p>Video surveillance equipment shall not be used to harass, intimidate or discriminate against any individual or group.</p>
    <h4>378.7.2 VIDEO LOG</h4>
    <p>A log should be maintained at all locations where video surveillance monitors are located. The log should be used to document all persons not assigned to the monitoring locations who have been given access to view or monitor images provided by the
        video surveillance cameras. The logs should, at a minimum, record the:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Date and time access was given.</li>
        <li>Name and agency of the person being given access to the images.</li>
        <li>Name of person authorizing access.</li>
        <li>Identifiable portion of images viewed.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>378.8 RELEASE OF VIDEO IMAGES</h3>
    <p>All recorded video images gathered by the public safety video surveillance equipment are for the official use of the Metro Transit Police Department and are classified as law enforcement data under Minn. Stat. § 13.82.</p>
    <p>Requests for recorded video images from the public or the media shall be processed in the same manner as requests for department public records under the Minnesota Government Data Practices Act. Except as required by a statute, court order or other
        lawful process consistent with the provisions of Minn. Stat. § 13.82, video images requested under the Minnesota Government Data Practices Act will generally not be disclosed to the public when such video images are evidence in an ongoing criminal
        investigation in which a disposition has not been reached.</p>
    <p>Requests for recorded images from other law enforcement agencies shall be referred to the Shift Supervisor for release in accordance with a specific and legitimate law enforcement purpose.</p>
    <p>Recorded video images that are the subject of a court order or subpoena shall be processed in accordance with the established department subpoena process.</p>

    <h2>380 - Child and Dependent Adult Safety</h2>
    <h3>380.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>This policy provides guidelines to ensure that children and dependent adults are not left without appropriate care in the event their caregiver or guardian is arrested or otherwise prevented from providing care due to actions taken by members of this
        department.</p>
    <p>This policy does not address the actions to be taken during the course of a child abuse or vulnerable adult investigation. These are covered in the Child Abuse and Adult Abuse.</p>

    <h3>380.2 POLICY</h3>
    <p>It is the policy of this department to mitigate, to the extent reasonably possible, the stressful experience individuals may have when a parent or caregiver is arrested. The Metro Transit Police Department will endeavor to create a strong cooperative
        relationship with local, state and community-based social services to ensure an effective, collaborative response that addresses the needs of those affected.</p>

    <h3>380.3 PROCEDURES DURING AN ARREST</h3>
    <p>When encountering an arrest or prolonged detention situation, officers should make reasonable attempts to determine if the arrestee is responsible for children or dependent adults. In some cases this may be obvious, such as when children or dependent
        adults are present. However, officers should inquire if the arrestee has caregiver responsibilities for any children or dependent adults who are without appropriate supervision. The following steps should be taken:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Inquire about and confirm the location of any children or dependent adults.</li>
        <li>Look for evidence of children and dependent adults. Officers should be mindful that some arrestees may conceal the fact that they have a dependent for fear the individual may be taken from them.</li>
        <li>Consider inquiring of witnesses, neighbors, friends and relatives of the arrestee as to whether the person is responsible for a child or dependent adult.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Whenever reasonably possible, officers should take reasonable steps to accomplish the arrest of a parent, guardian or caregiver out of the presence of his/her child or dependent adult. Removing children or dependent adults from the scene in advance
        of the arrest will generally ensure the best outcome for the individual.</p>
    <p>Whenever it is safe to do so, officers should allow the parent or caregiver to assure children or dependent adults that they will be provided care. If this is not safe or if the demeanor of the parent or caregiver suggests this conversation would
        be nonproductive, the officer at the scene should explain the reason for the arrest in age-appropriate language and offer reassurance to the child or dependent adult that he/she will receive appropriate care.</p>
    <h4>380.3.1 AFTER AN ARREST</h4>
    <p>Whenever an arrest is made, the officer should take all reasonable steps to ensure the safety of the arrestee’s disclosed or discovered children or dependent adults.</p>
    <p>Officers should allow the arrestee reasonable time to arrange for care of children and dependent adults. Temporary placement with family or friends may be appropriate. However, any decision should give priority to a care solution that is in the best
        interest of the child or dependent adult. In such cases the following guidelines should be followed:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Allow the person reasonable time to arrange for the care of children and dependent adults with a responsible party, as appropriate.
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>Unless there is evidence to the contrary (e.g., signs of abuse, drug use, unsafe environment), officers should respect the parent or caregiver’s judgment regarding arrangements for care. It is generally best if the child or dependent adult
                    remains with relatives or family friends that he/she knows and trusts because familiarity with surroundings and consideration for comfort, emotional state and safety are important.
                </li>
                <li>Except when a court order exists limiting contact, the officer should attempt to locate and place children or dependent adults with the non-arrested parent, guardian or caregiver.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Provide for the immediate supervision of children or dependent adults until an appropriate caregiver arrives.</li>
        <li>Notify the county social services agency, if appropriate.</li>
        <li>Notify the field supervisor or Shift Supervisor of the disposition of children or dependent adults.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If children or dependent adults are at school or another known location outside the household at the time of arrest, the arresting officer should attempt to contact the school or other known location and inform the principal or appropriate responsible
        adult of the caregiver’s arrest and of the arrangements being made for the care of the arrestee’s dependent. The result of such actions should be documented in the associated report.</p>
    <h4>380.3.2 DURING THE BOOKING PROCESS</h4>
    <p>During the booking process, the arrestee shall be allowed to make additional telephone calls to relatives or other responsible individuals as is reasonably necessary to arrange for the care of any child or dependent adult. These telephone calls should
        be given as soon as practicable and are in addition to any other telephone calls allowed by law.</p>
    <p>If an arrestee is unable to resolve the care of any child or dependent adult through this process, a supervisor should be contacted to determine the appropriate steps to arrange for care. These steps may include additional telephone calls or contacting
        a local, county or state services agency.</p>
    <h4>380.3.3 REPORTING</h4>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>For all arrests where children are present or living in the household, the reporting employee will document the following information:
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>Name</li>
                <li>Sex</li>
                <li>Age</li>
                <li>How, where and with whom or which agency the child was placed</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>For all arrests where dependent adults are present or living in the household, the reporting employee should document the following information about the dependent adult:
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>Name</li>
                <li>Sex</li>
                <li>Age</li>
                <li>Whether he/she reasonably appears able to care for him/herself</li>
                <li>Disposition or placement information if he/she is unable to care for him/herself</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>380.3.4 SUPPORT AND COUNSELING REFERRAL</h4>
    <p>If, in the judgment of the handling officers, the child or dependent adult would benefit from additional assistance, such as counseling services, contact with a victim advocate or a crisis telephone number, the appropriate referral information may
        be provided.</p>

    <h3>380.4 DEPENDENT WELFARE SERVICES</h3>
    <p>Whenever an arrestee is unwilling or incapable of arranging for the appropriate care of any child or dependent adult, the handling officer should consider contacting the appropriate welfare service or other department-approved social service entity
        to determine whether protective custody is appropriate (Minn. Stat. § 260C.007; Minn. Stat. § 260C.175 ).</p>
    <p>Only when other reasonable options are exhausted should a child or dependent adult be transported to the police facility, transported in a marked patrol car or taken into formal protective custody.</p>
    <p>Under no circumstances should a child or dependent adult be left unattended or without appropriate care.</p>

    <h3>380.5 TRAINING</h3>
    <p>The Training Coordinator is responsible to ensure that all personnel of this department who may be involved in arrests affecting children or dependent adults receive approved training on effective safety measures when a parent, guardian or caregiver
        is arrested.</p>
</div>
            <div class="chapter" id="382">
    <h2>382 - Service Animals</h2>
    <h3>382.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>Service animals play an important role in helping to overcome the limitations often faced by people with disabilities. The Metro Transit Police Department recognizes this need and is committed to making reasonable modifications to its policies, practices
        and procedures in accordance with Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) to permit the use of service animals that are individually trained to assist a person with a disability.</p>
    <h4>382.1.1 DEFINITIONS</h4>
    <p>Definitions related to this policy include:</p>
    <p><strong>Service animal</strong> - A dog that is trained to do work or perform tasks for the benefit of an individual with a disability, including a physical, sensory, psychiatric, intellectual or other mental disability. The work or tasks performed
        by a service animal must be directly related to the individual's disability (28 CFR 35.104).</p>
    <p>Service animal also includes a miniature horse if the horse is trained to do work or perform tasks for people with disabilities, provided the horse is housebroken, is under the handler’s control, the facility can accommodate the horse’s type, size
        and weight, and the horse’s presence will not compromise legitimate safety requirements necessary for safe operation of the facility (28 CFR 35.136(i)).</p>

    <h3>382.2 POLICY</h3>
    <p>It is the policy of the Metro Transit Police Department to provide services and access to persons with service animals in the same manner as those without service animals. Department members shall protect the rights of persons assisted by service
        animals in accordance with state and federal law.</p>

    <h3>382.3 IDENTIFICATION AND USE OF SERVICE ANIMALS</h3>
    <p>Some service animals may be readily identifiable. However, many do not have a distinctive symbol, harness or collar. Service animals are not pets and may be trained by an individual or organization to assist people with disabilities.</p>
    <p>Examples of the ways service animals may be used to provide assistance include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Guiding people who are blind or have low vision.</li>
        <li>Alerting people who are deaf or hard of hearing.</li>
        <li>Retrieving or picking up items, opening doors or flipping switches for people who have limited use of their hands, arms or legs.</li>
        <li>Pulling wheelchairs.</li>
        <li>Providing physical support and assisting with stability and balance.</li>
        <li>Doing work or performing tasks for persons with traumatic brain injury, intellectual disabilities or psychiatric disabilities, such as reminding a person with depression to take medication.</li>
        <li>Alerting a person with anxiety to the onset of panic attacks, providing tactile stimulation to calm a person with post-traumatic stress disorder, assisting people with schizophrenia to distinguish between hallucinations and reality, and helping
            people with traumatic brain injury to locate misplaced items or follow daily routines.</p>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h3>382.4 MEMBER RESPONSIBILITIES</h3>
    <p>Service animals that are assisting individuals with disabilities are permitted in all public facilities and areas where the public is allowed. Department members are expected to treat individuals with service animals with the same courtesy and respect
        that the Metro Transit Police Department affords to all members of the public (see generally Minn. Stat. § 256C.02; Minn. Stat. § 363A.19).</p>
    <h4>382.4.1 REMOVAL</h4>
    <p>If an animal exhibits vicious behavior, poses a direct threat to the health of others or unreasonably disrupts or interferes with normal business operations, an officer may direct the owner to remove the animal from the premises. Barking alone is
        not a threat nor does a direct threat exist if the person takes prompt, effective action to control the animal. Each incident must be considered individually. Past incidents alone are not cause for excluding a service animal. Removal of a service
        animal may not be used as a reason to refuse service to an individual with disabilities. Members of this department are expected to provide all services as are reasonably available to an individual with the disability.</p>
    <h4>382.4.2 INQUIRY</h4>
    <p>If it is apparent or if an officer is aware the animal is a service animal, the owner should not be asked any questions as to the status of the animal. If it is unclear whether an animal meets the definition of a service animal, the officer should
        ask the individual only the following questions:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Is the animal required because of a disability?</li>
        <li>What task or service has the animal been trained to perform?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If the individual explains that the animal is required because of a disability and has been trained to work or perform at least one task, the animal meets the definition of a service animal, and no further question as to the animal’s status should
        be asked. The person should not be questioned about his/her disabilities nor should the person be asked to provide any license, certification or identification card for the service animal.</p>
    <h4>382.4.3 CONTACT</h4>
    <p>Service animals are not pets. Department members should not interfere with the important work performed by a service animal by talking to, petting or otherwise initiating contact with a service animal.</p>
    <h4>382.4.4 COMPLAINTS</h4>
    <p>When handling calls of a complaint regarding a service animal, members of this department should remain neutral and should be prepared to explain the ADA requirements concerning service animals to the concerned parties. Businesses are required to
        allow service animals to accompany their owner into all areas that other customers or members of the public are allowed.</p>
    <p>Absent a violation of law independent of the ADA, officers should take no enforcement action beyond keeping the peace. Individuals who believe they have been discriminated against as a result of a disability should be referred to the Civil Rights
        Division of the U.S. Department of Justice or the Minnesota Department of Human Rights.</p>

    <h2>388 - Off-Duty Law Enforcement Actions</h2>
    <h3>388.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>The decision to become involved in a law enforcement action when off-duty can place an officer as well as others at great risk and must be done with careful consideration. This policy is intended to provide guidelines for officers of the Metro Transit
        Police Department with respect to taking law enforcement action while off-duty.</p>

    <h3>388.2 POLICY</h3>
    <p>Officers generally should not initiate law enforcement action while off-duty. Officers should not attempt to initiate enforcement action when witnessing minor crimes, such as suspected intoxicated drivers, reckless driving or minor property crimes.
        Such incidents should be promptly reported to the appropriate law enforcement agency.</p>
    <p>When the safety of the public or the prevention of major property damage requires immediate action, officers should first consider reporting and monitoring the activity and only take direct action as a last resort.</p>
    <p>Officers are not expected to place themselves in unreasonable peril. However, any licensed member of this department who becomes aware of an incident or circumstance that he/she reasonably believes poses an imminent threat of serious bodily injury
        or death or significant property damage may take reasonable action to minimize the threat.</p>

    <h3>388.3 FIREARMS</h3>
    <p>Officers of this department may carry firearms while off-duty in accordance with federal regulations, state law and department policy. All firearms and ammunition must meet guidelines as described in the Firearms Policy. When carrying firearms while
        off-duty, officers shall also carry their department-issued badge and identification.</p>
    <p>Officers should refrain from carrying firearms when the consumption of alcohol is likely or when the need to carry a firearm is outweighed by safety considerations. Firearms shall not be carried by any officer who has consumed an amount of an alcoholic
        beverage or taken any drugs that would tend to adversely affect the officer’s senses or judgment.</p>

    <h3>388.4 DECISION TO INTERVENE</h3>
    <p>There is no legal requirement for off-duty officers to take law enforcement action. However, should officers decide to intervene, they must evaluate whether the action is necessary or desirable and should take into consideration:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>The tactical disadvantage of being alone and the fact there may be multiple or hidden suspects.</li>
        <li>The inability to communicate with responding units.</li>
        <li>The lack of equipment, such as handcuffs, Oleoresin Capsicum (OC) spray or a baton.</li>
        <li>The lack of cover.</li>
        <li>The potential for increased risk to bystanders if the off-duty officer were to intervene.</li>
        <li>Unfamiliarity with the surroundings.</li>
        <li>The potential for the off-duty officer to be misidentified by other peace officers or members of the public.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Officers should consider waiting for on-duty uniformed officers to arrive and gather as much accurate intelligence as possible instead of immediately intervening.</p>
    <h4>388.4.1 INTERVENTION PROCEDURE</h4>
    <p>If involvement is reasonably necessary, the officer should attempt to call or have someone else call 9-1-1 to request immediate assistance. The operator should be informed that an off-duty officer is on-scene and should be provided a description of
        the officer if reasonably possible.</p>
    <p>Whenever reasonably practicable, the officer should loudly and repeatedly identify him/herself as an Metro Transit Police Department officer until acknowledged. Official identification should also be displayed.</p>
    <h4>388.4.2 INCIDENTS OF PERSONAL INTEREST</h4>
    <p>Officers should refrain from handling incidents of personal interest (e.g., family or neighbor disputes) and should remain neutral. In such circumstances, officers should call the responsible agency to handle the matter.</p>
    <h4>388.4.3 NON-LICENSED RESPONSIBILITIES</h4>
    <p>Non-licensed personnel should not become involved in any law enforcement actions while off- duty except to notify the local law enforcement authority and remain at the scene, if safe and reasonably practicable.</p>
    <h4>388.4.4 OTHER CONSIDERATIONS</h4>
    <p>When encountering a non-uniformed officer in public, uniformed officers should wait for acknowledgement by the non-uniformed officer in case he/she needs to maintain an undercover capability.</p>

    <h3>388.5 REPORTING</h3>
    <p>Any officer, taking any off-duty law enforcement action, shall notify a Metro Transit Police Department supervisor (or other applicable enforcement authority if acting outside the jurisdiction of the Metro Transit Police Department). The Shift Supervisor
        shall determine whether a report should be filed by the employee.</p>
    <p>Officers should cooperate fully with the agency having jurisdiction in providing statements or reports as requested or as appropriate.</p>

    <h2>400 - Patrol Function</h2>
    <h3>400.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this policy is to define the functions of the patrol unit of the Department to ensure intra-organization cooperation and information sharing.</p>

    <h2>402 - Racial- or Bias-Based Profiling</h2>
    <h3>402.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>This policy provides guidance to department members and establishes appropriate controls to ensure that employees of the Metro Transit Police Department do not engage in racial- or bias- based profiling or violate any related laws while serving the
        community.</p>
    <h4>402.1.1 DEFINITIONS</h4>
    <p>Definitions related to this policy include:</p>
    <p><strong>Racial- or bias-based profiling</strong> - An inappropriate reliance on factors such as race, ethnicity, national origin, religion, sex, sexual orientation, economic status, age, cultural group, disability or affiliation with any other similar
        identifiable group as a factor in deciding whether to take law enforcement action or to provide service.</p>
    <p>This includes use of racial or ethnic stereotypes as factors in selecting whom to stop and search. It does not include law enforcement's use of race or ethnicity to determine whether a person matches a specific description of a particular subject
        (Minn. Stat. § 626.8471).</p>

    <h3>402.2 POLICY</h3>
    <p>The Metro Transit Police Department is committed to providing law enforcement services to the community with due regard for the racial, cultural or other differences of those served. It is the policy of this department to provide law enforcement services
        and to enforce the law equally, fairly and without discrimination toward any individual or group.</p>
    <p>Race, ethnicity or nationality, religion, sex, sexual orientation, economic status, age, cultural group, disability or affiliation with any other similar identifiable group shall not be used as the basis for providing differing levels of law enforcement
        service or the enforcement of the law (Minn. Stat. § 626.8471, Subd. 3).</p>

    <h3>402.3 RACIAL- OR BIAS-BASED PROFILING PROHIBITED</h3>
    <p>Racial- or bias-based profiling is strictly prohibited. However, nothing in this policy is intended to prohibit an officer from considering factors such as race or ethnicity in combination with other legitimate factors to establish reasonable suspicion
        or probable cause (e.g., suspect description is limited to a specific race or group).</p>
    <p>Officers may take into account factors including the race, ethnicity, national origin, gender, sexual orientation and religion of a specific suspect based on information that links specific, suspected, unlawful or suspicious activity to a particular
        individual or group of individuals. This information may be used in the same manner officers use specific information regarding age, height or weight about specific suspects.</p>

    <h3>402.4 MEMBER RESPONSIBILITY</h3>
    <p>Every member of this department shall perform his/her duties in a fair and objective manner and is responsible for promptly reporting any known instances of racial- or bias-based profiling to a supervisor.</p>
    <h4>402.4.1 REASON FOR DETENTION</h4>
    <p>Officers detaining a person shall be prepared to articulate sufficient reasonable suspicion to justify a detention, independent of the individual's membership in a protected class.</p>
    <p>To the extent that written documentation would otherwise be completed (e.g., arrest report etc), the involved officer should include those facts giving rise to the officer's reasonable suspicion or probable cause for the detention, as applicable.</p>
    <p>Nothing in this policy shall require any officer to document a contact that would not otherwise require reporting.</p>
    <h3>402.4.2 INFORMATION TO BE PROVIDED</h3>
    <p>Officers shall (Minn. Stat. § 626.8471, Subd. 3):</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Introduce or identify themselves and state the reason for a contact as soon as practicable unless providing the information could compromise officer or public safety.</li>
        <li>Attempt to answer questions the person may have regarding the contact, including relevant referrals to other agencies when appropriate.</li>
        <li>Explain the reason for the contact if it is determined the reasonable suspicion was unfounded.</li>
        <li>When requested, officers have a duty to give their name, badge number and identify this department during routine stops.</li>
        <li>When requested, officers should inform a member of the public of the process to file a misconduct complaint for racial- or bias-based profiling against a member of the Department, and that racial- or bias-based profiling complaints may be made
            by calling the Attorney General's office (Minn. Stat. § 626.9514).</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>402.5 SUPERVISOR RESPONSIBILITY</h3>
    <p>Supervisors shall monitor those individuals under their command for any behavior that may conflict with the purpose of this policy and shall handle any alleged or observed violation of this policy in accordance with the Personnel Complaints Policy.</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Supervisors should discuss any issues with the involved officer and his/her supervisor in a timely manner.</li>
        <li>Supervisors should periodically review MAV recordings, MDC data and any other available resource used to document contact between officers and the public to ensure compliance with this policy.
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>Supervisors should document these periodic reviews.</li>
                <li>Recordings that capture a potential instance of racial- or bias-based profiling should be appropriately retained for administrative investigation purposes.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Supervisors shall initiate investigations of any actual or alleged violations of this policy.</li>
        <li>Supervisors should ensure that no retaliatory action is taken against any member of this department who discloses information concerning racial- or bias-based profiling.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>402.6 ADMINISTRATION</h3>
    <p>Each year, the Patrol Captain shall review the efforts of the Department to prevent racial- or bias- based profiling and submit an overview, including public concerns and complaints, to the Chief of Police. This report should not contain any identifying
        information regarding any specific complaint, citizen or officers. It should be reviewed by the Chief of Police to identify any changes in training or operations that should be made to improve service.</p>
    <p>Supervisors shall review the annual report and discuss the results with those they are assigned to supervise.</p>

    <h3>402.7 TRAINING</h3>
    <p>Training on racial- or bias-based profiling and review of this policy should be conducted as directed by the Professional Standards Unit.</p>
    <p>The Chief of Police and supervisors should receive and review training materials prepared by the Board of Peace Officer Standards and Training (POST) (Minn. Stat. § 626.8471, Subd. 7).</p>

            <div class="chapter" id="404">
    <h2>404 - Roll Call Training</h2>
    <h3>404.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>Roll Call training is generally conducted at the beginning of the officer's assigned shift. Roll Call provides an opportunity for important exchange between employees and supervisors. A supervisor generally will conduct Roll Call. However, officers
        may conduct Roll Call for training purposes with supervisor approval.</p>
    <p>Roll Call should accomplish, at a minimum, the following basic tasks:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Briefing officers with information regarding daily patrol activity, with particular attention given to unusual situations and changes in the status of wanted persons, stolen vehicles and major investigations.</li>
        <li>Notifying officers of changes in schedules and assignments.</li>
        <li>Notifying officers of new Interim Directives or changes in Interim Directives.</li>
        <li>Reviewing recent incidents for training purposes.</li>
        <li>Providing training on a variety of subjects.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>404.2 PREPARATION OF MATERIALS</h3>
    <p>The supervisor conducting Roll Call, or the officer if the supervisor is unable to participate in a group briefing session, is responsible for collection and preparation of the materials necessary for a constructive briefing. Supervisors may delegate
        this responsibility to a subordinate officer in his/ her absence or for training purposes.</p>

    <h3>404.3 RETENTION OF BRIEFING TRAINING RECORDS</h3>
    <p>Roll Call training materials and a curriculum or summary shall be forwarded to the Training Coordinator for inclusion in training records as appropriate.</p>

    <h2>406 - Crime and Disaster Scene Integrity</h2>
    <h3>406.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this policy is to provide guidance in handling a major crime or disaster.</p>

    <h3>406.2 POLICY</h3>
    <p>It is the policy of the Metro Transit Police Department to secure crime or disaster scenes so that evidence is preserved, and to identify and mitigate the dangers associated with a major crime or disaster scene for the safety of the community and
        those required to enter or work near the scene.</p>

    <h3>406.3 SCENE RESPONSIBILITY</h3>
    <p>The first officer at the scene of a crime or major incident is generally responsible for the immediate safety of the public and preservation of the scene. Officers shall also consider officer safety and the safety of those persons entering or exiting
        the area, including those rendering medical aid to any injured parties. Once an officer has assumed or been assigned to maintain the integrity and security of the crime or disaster scene, the officer shall maintain the crime or disaster scene
        until he/she is properly relieved by a supervisor or other designated person.</p>

    <h3>406.4 FIRST RESPONDER CONSIDERATIONS</h3>
    <p>The following list generally describes the first responder’s function at a crime or disaster scene. This list is not intended to be all-inclusive, is not necessarily in order and may be altered according to the demands of each situation:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Broadcast emergency information, including requests for additional assistance and resources.</li>
        <li>Provide for the general safety of those within the immediate area by mitigating, reducing or eliminating threats or dangers.</li>
        <li>Locate or identify suspects and determine whether dangerous suspects are still within the area.</li>
        <li>Provide first aid to injured parties if it can be done safely.</li>
        <li>Evacuate the location safely as required or appropriate.</li>
        <li>Secure the inner perimeter.</li>
        <li>Protect items of apparent evidentiary value.</li>
        <li>Secure an outer perimeter.</li>
        <li>Identify potential witnesses.</li>
        <li>Start a chronological log noting critical times and personnel allowed access.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>406.5 SEARCHES</h3>
    <p>Officers arriving at crime or disaster scenes are often faced with the immediate need to search for and render aid to victims, and to determine if suspects are present and continue to pose a threat. Once officers are satisfied that no additional suspects
        are present and/or there are no injured persons to be treated, those exigent circumstances will likely no longer exist. Officers should thereafter secure the scene and conduct no further search until additional or alternate authority for the search
        is obtained, such as consent or a search warrant.</p>
    <h4>406.5.1 CONSENT</h4>
    <p>When possible, officers should seek written consent to search from authorized individuals. However, in the case of serious crimes or major investigations, it may be prudent to also obtain a search warrant. Consent as an additional authorization may
        be sought, even in cases where a search warrant has been granted.</p>

    <h3>406.6 EXECUTION OF HEALTH ORDERS</h3>
    <p>Any licensed member of this department may assist in the enforcement of all directives of the local health officer issued for the purpose of preventing the spread of any contagious, infectious or communicable disease (Minn. Stat. § 144.4195, Subd.
        2).</p>

        <li>Denial by any supervisor.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>410.1.2 AVAILABILITY</h4>
    <p>The Ride-Along Program is available on most days of the week. The ride-along times are from 10:00 a.m. to 11:00 p.m. Exceptions to this schedule may be made as approved by the Chief of Police, Deputy Chief of Police, Patrol Captain or Shift Supervisor.</p>

    <h3>410.2 PROCEDURE TO REQUEST A RIDE-ALONG</h3>
    <p>Generally, ride-along requests will be scheduled by the Shift Supervisor. The participant will complete and sign a ride-along waiver form. Information requested will include a valid driver's license, address and telephone number.</p>
    <p>The Shift Supervisor will schedule a date, based on availability, sometime after the date of application. If approved, a copy of the ride-along waiver form will be forwarded to the respective Shift Supervisor as soon as possible for his/her scheduling
        considerations.</p>
    <p>If the ride-along is denied after the request has been made, a representative of the Department will contact the applicant and advise him/her of the denial.</p>
    <h4>410.2.1 PROGRAM REQUIREMENTS</h4>
    <p>Once approved, civilian ride-alongs will be allowed to ride no more than once every six months. An exception would apply to the following: chaplains, police applicants and all others with approval of the Shift Supervisor.</p>
    <p>An effort will be made to ensure that no more than one citizen will participate in a ride-along during any given time period. Normally, no more than one ride-along will be allowed in the officer's vehicle at a given time.</p>
    <p>Ride-along requirements for CSO's are covered in Policy Manual § 1048, "Community Service Officers."</p>
    <h4>410.2.2 SUITABLE ATTIRE</h4>
    <p>Any person approved to ride-along is required to be suitably dressed. Sandals, tank tops, shorts and ripped or torn blue jeans are not permitted. Hats and ball caps will not be worn in the police vehicle. The Shift Supervisor or field supervisor may

    <h4>410.2.3 PEACE OFFICER RIDE-ALONGS</h4>
    <p>Off-duty members of this department or any other law enforcement agency will not be permitted to ride-along with on-duty officers without the express consent of the Shift Supervisor. In the event that such a ride-along is permitted, the off-duty employee
        shall not be considered on-duty and shall not represent him/herself as a peace officer or participate in any law enforcement activity except as emergency circumstances may require or as directed by an on-duty member.</p>
    <h4>410.2.4 RIDE-ALONG CRIMINAL HISTORY CHECK</h4>
    <p>All ride-along applicants are subject to a criminal history check. The criminal history check may include a local records check and a Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension Criminal History System check prior to approval (provided that the ride-along
        is not an employee of the ).</p>

    <h3>410.3 OFFICER'S RESPONSIBILITIES</h3>
    <p>The officer shall advise the dispatcher that a ride-along is present in the vehicle before going into service. Officers shall consider the safety of the ride-along at all times.</p>
    <p>Officers should use sound discretion when encountering a potentially dangerous situation, and if feasible, let the participant out of the vehicle in a well-lighted place of safety. The dispatcher will be advised of the situation and as soon as practicable
        have another police unit respond to pick up the participant at that location. The ride-along may be continued or terminated at this time.</p>
    <p>Conduct by a person participating in a ride-along that results in termination of the ride or is otherwise inappropriate should be immediately reported to the Shift Supervisor.</p>
    <p>The Shift Supervisor is responsible for maintaining and scheduling ride-alongs. Upon completion of the ride-along, a copy of the ride-along waiver form shall be returned to the Shift Supervisor with any comments that may be offered by the officer.</p>

    <h3>CONTROL OF RIDE-ALONG</h3>
    <p>The assigned employee shall maintain control over the ride-along at all times and instruct him/her in the conditions that necessarily limit participation. These instructions should include:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>The ride-along will follow the directions of the officer.</li>
        <li>The ride-along will not become involved in any investigation, handling of evidence, discussions with victims or suspects or handling any police equipment.</li>
        <li>The ride-along may terminate the ride at any time and the officer may return the observer to his/her home or to the station if the ride-along interferes with the performance of the officer's duties.</li>
        <li>The officer may terminate the ride-along and return the observer to their home or to the station if the ride-along interferes with the performance of any officer's duties.</li>
        <li>Ride-alongs may be allowed to continue riding during the transportation and booking process provided this does not jeopardize their safety.</li>
        <li>Officers will not allow any ride-alongs to be present in any residence or situation that would jeopardize their safety or cause undue stress or embarrassment to a victim or any other person.</li>

    <h2>412 - Hazadous Material Response</h2>
    <h3>412.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>Hazardous materials present a potential harm to employees as a result of their exposure. To comply with Minnesota law, the following represents the policy of this department.</p>
    <h4>412.1.1 HAZARDOUS MATERIAL DEFINED</h4>
    <p><strong>Hazardous material</strong> - Any refuse, sludge or other waste material or combinations of refuse, sludge or other waste materials in solid, semisolid, liquid or contained gaseous form, which, because of its quantity, concentration, or chemical,
        physical or infectious characteristics may (Minn. Stat. § 116.06 Subd. 11):</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Cause or significantly contribute to an increase in mortality or an increase in serious irreversible or incapacitating reversible illness.</li>
        <li>Pose a substantial present or potential hazard to human health or the environment when improperly treated, stored, transported, disposed of or otherwise managed.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>412.2 HAZARDOUS MATERIAL RESPONSE</h3>
    <p>Employees may encounter situations involving suspected hazardous materials, such as at the scene of a traffic collision, chemical spill or fire. When employees come into contact with a suspected hazardous material, certain steps should be taken to
        protect themselves and other persons.</p>
    <p>The fire department is the agency trained and equipped to properly respond and mitigate most hazardous materials and biohazards.</p>
    <p>Responders should not perform tasks or use equipment absent proper training. A responder entering the area may require decontamination before he/she is allowed to depart the scene and should be evaluated by appropriate technicians and medical professionals
        for signs of exposure.</p>
    <p>The following steps should be considered at any scene involving suspected hazardous materials:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Attempt to identify the type of hazardous material. Identification can be determined by placard, driver's manifest or statements from the person transporting the material</li>
        <li>Notify the appropriate fire department.</li>
        <li>Provide first aid to injured parties if it can be done safely and without contamination.</li>
        <li>Begin evacuation of the immediate and surrounding areas dependent on the material. Voluntary evacuation should be considered. Depending on the material, mandatory evacuation may be necessary.</li>
        <li>Contact the Minnesota Duty Officer (800-422-0798).</li>
        <li>Responders should remain uphill and upwind of the hazard until a zone of entry and a decontamination area are established.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>412.3 REPORTING EXPOSURE(S)</h3>
    <p>Department personnel who believe that they have been exposed to a hazardous material shall immediately report the exposure to a supervisor. Each exposure shall be documented by the employee in an employee memorandum that shall be forwarded via chain
        of command to their supervisor. Should the affected employee be unable to document the exposure for any reason, it shall be the responsibility of the notified supervisor to complete the memorandum.</p>
    <p>Injury or illness caused or believed to be caused from exposure to hazardous materials shall be reported the same as any other on-duty injury or illness, in addition to a crime report or incident report.</p>
    <h4>412.3.1 SUPERVISOR RESPONSIBILITIES</h4>
    <p>When a supervisor has been informed that an employee has been exposed to a hazardous material, he/she shall ensure that immediate medical treatment is obtained and appropriate action is taken to lessen the exposure.</p>
    <p>To ensure the safety of employees, safety equipment is available through supervisory personnel. Safety items not maintained by the Department will be obtained through the appropriate fire department.</p>

            <div class="chapter" id="414">
    <h2>414 - Hostage and Barricade Incidents</h2>
    <h3>414.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this policy is to provide guidelines for situations where officers have legal cause to contact, detain or arrest a person, and the person refuses to submit to the lawful requests of the officers by remaining in a structure or vehicle
        and/or by taking a hostage.</p>
    <p>The scope of this policy is not intended to address all variables that officers encounter during their initial response or when a hostage or barricade situation has developed. This policy does not require or purport to recommend specific strategies
        or tactics for resolution as each incident is a dynamic and rapidly evolving event.</p>
    <h4>414.1.1 DEFINITIONS</h4>
    <p>Definitions related to this policy include:</p>
    <p><strong>Barricade situation</strong> - An incident where a person maintains a position of cover or concealment and ignores or resists law enforcement personnel, and it is reasonable to believe the subject is armed with a dangerous or deadly weapon.</p>
    <p><strong>Hostage situation</strong> - An incident where it is reasonable to believe a person is unlawfully held by a hostage-taker as security so that specified terms or conditions will be met.</p>

    <h3>414.2 POLICY</h3>
    <p>It is the policy of the Metro Transit Police Department to address hostage and barricade situations with due regard for the preservation of life and balancing the risk of injury, while obtaining the safe release of hostages, apprehending offenders
        and securing available evidence.</p>

    <h3>414.3 COMMUNICATION</h3>
    <p>When circumstances permit, initial responding officers should try to establish and maintain lines of communication with a barricaded person or hostage-taker. Officers should attempt to identify any additional subjects, inquire about victims and injuries,
        seek the release of hostages, gather intelligence information, identify time-sensitive demands or conditions and obtain the suspect’s surrender.</p>
    <p>When available, department-authorized negotiators should respond to the scene as soon as practicable and assume communication responsibilities. Negotiators are permitted to exercise flexibility in each situation based upon their training, the circumstances
        presented, suspect actions or demands and the available resources.</p>
    <h4>414.3.1 EMERGENCY COMMUNICATION</h4>
    <p>A supervisor with probable cause to believe that a person is being unlawfully confined may order a telephone company to cut, reroute, or divert telephone lines for the purpose of establishing and controlling communications with a suspect (Minn. Stat.
        § 609.774).</p>

    <h3>414.4 FIRST RESPONDER CONSIDERATION</h3>
    <p>First responding officers should promptly and carefully evaluate all available information to determine whether an incident involves, or may later develop into, a hostage or barricade situation.</p>
    <p>The first responding officer should immediately request a supervisor’s response as soon as it is determined that a hostage or barricade situation exists. The first responding officer shall assume the duties of the supervisor until relieved by a supervisor
        or a more qualified responder. The officer shall continually evaluate the situation, including the level of risk to officers, to the persons involved and to bystanders, and the resources currently available.</p>
    <p>The handling officer should brief the arriving supervisor of the incident, including information about suspects and victims, the extent of any injuries, additional resources or equipment that may be needed, and current perimeters and evacuation areas.</p>
    <h4>414.4.1 BARRICADE SITUATION</h4>
    <p>Unless circumstances require otherwise, officers handling a barricade situation should attempt to avoid a forceful confrontation in favor of stabilizing the incident by establishing and maintaining lines of communication while awaiting the arrival
        of specialized personnel and trained negotiators. During the interim the following options, while not all-inclusive or in any particular order, should be considered:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Ensure injured persons are evacuated from the immediate threat area if it is reasonably safe to do so. Request medical assistance.</li>
        <li>Assign personnel to a contact team to control the subject should he/she attempt to exit the building, structure or vehicle, and attack, use deadly force, attempt to escape or surrender prior to additional resources arriving.</li>
        <li>Request additional personnel, resources and equipment as needed (e.g., canine team, air support).</li>
        <li>Provide responding emergency personnel with a safe arrival route to the location.</li>
        <li>Evacuate non-injured persons in the immediate threat area if it is reasonably safe to do so.</li>
        <li>Attempt or obtain a line of communication and gather as much information on the subject as possible, including weapons, other involved parties, additional hazards or injuries.</li>
        <li>Establish an inner and outer perimeter as circumstances require and resources permit to prevent unauthorized access.</li>
        <li>Evacuate bystanders, residents and businesses within the inner and then outer perimeter as appropriate. Check for injuries, the presence of other involved subjects, witnesses, evidence or additional information.</li>
        <li>Determine the need for and notify the appropriate persons within and outside the Department (e.g., command staff and the Public Information Officer etc).</li>
        <li>If necessary and available, establish a tactical or exclusive radio frequency for the incident.</li>
        <li>Establish a command post.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>414.4.2 HOSTAGE SITUATION</h4>
    <p>Officers presented with a hostage situation should attempt to avoid a forceful confrontation in favor of controlling the incident in anticipation of the arrival of specialized personnel and trained hostage negotiators. However, it is understood that
        hostage situations are dynamic and can require that officers react quickly to developing or changing threats. The following options while not all-inclusive or in any particular order, should be considered:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Ensure injured persons are evacuated from the immediate threat area if it is reasonably safe to do so. Request medical assistance.</li>
        <li>Assign personnel to a contact team to control the subject should he/she attempt to exit the building, structure or vehicle, and attack, use deadly force, attempt to escape or surrender prior to additional resources arriving.</li>
        <li>Establish a rapid response team in the event it becomes necessary to rapidly enter a building, structure or vehicle, such as when the suspect is using deadly force against any hostages (see the Rapid Response and Deployment Policy).</li>
        <li>Assist hostages or potential hostages to escape if it is reasonably safe to do so. Hostages should be kept separated if practicable pending further interview.</li>
        <li>Request additional personnel, resources and equipment as needed (e.g., canine team, air support).</li>
        <li>Provide responding emergency personnel with a safe arrival route to the location.</li>
        <li>Evacuate non-injured persons in the immediate threat area if it is reasonably safe to do so.</li>
        <li>Coordinate pursuit or surveillance vehicles and control of travel routes.</li>
        <li>Attempt or obtain a line of communication and gather as much information about the suspect as possible, including any weapons, victims and their injuries, additional hazards, other involved parties and any other relevant intelligence information.</li>
        <li>Establish an inner and outer perimeter as resources and circumstances permit to prevent unauthorized access.</li>
        <li>Evacuate bystanders, residents and businesses within the inner and then outer perimeter as appropriate. Check for injuries, the presence of other involved subjects, witnesses, evidence or additional information.</li>
        <li>Determine the need for and notify the appropriate persons within and outside the Department, such as command staff and the Public Information Officer.</li>
        <li>If necessary and available, establish a tactical or exclusive radio frequency for the incident.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>414.5 SUPERVISOR RESPONSIBILITY</h3>
    <p>Upon being notified that a hostage or barricade situation exists, the supervisor should immediately respond to the scene, assess the risk level of the situation, establish a proper chain of command and assume the role of Incident Commander until properly
        relieved. This includes requesting a tactical response if appropriate and apprising the Tactical Team Commander of the circumstances. In addition, the following options, listed here in no particular order, should be considered:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Ensure injured persons are evacuated and treated by medical personnel.</li>
        <li>Ensure the completion of necessary first responder responsibilities or assignments.</li>
        <li>Request crisis negotiators, specialized units, additional personnel, resources or equipment as appropriate.</li>
        <li>Establish a command post location as resources and circumstances permit.</li>
        <li>Designate assistants who can help with intelligence information and documentation of the incident.</li>
        <li>If it is practicable to do so, arrange for video documentation of the operation.</li>
        <li>Consider contacting utility and communication providers when restricting such services (e.g., restricting electric power, gas, telephone service).</li>
        <li>Ensure adequate law enforcement coverage for the remainder of the Metropolitan Area during the incident. The supervisor should direct non-essential personnel away from the scene unless they have been summoned by the supervisor or Transit Control
            Center.</li>
        <li>Identify a media staging area outside the outer perimeter and have the department Public Information Officer or a designated temporary media representative provide media access in accordance with the Media Relations Policy</li>
        <li>Identify the need for mutual aid and the transition or relief of personnel for incidents of extended duration.</li>
        <li>Debrief personnel and review documentation as appropriate.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>414.6 CRISIS RESPONSE UNIT</h3>
    <p>It will be the Incident Commander's decision, with input from the Emergency Response Unit / Tactical Team Commander, whether to deploy the Unit / Team during a hostage or barricade situation. Once the Incident Commander authorizes deployment, the
        Unit / Team Commander or the authorized designee will be responsible for the tactical portion of the operation. The Incident Commander shall continue supervision of the command post operation, outer perimeter security and evacuation, media access
        and support for the Unit / Team. The Incident Commander and the Unit / Team Commander or the authorized designee shall maintain communications at all times.</p>

    <h3>414.7 REPORTING</h3>

    <h2>416 - Response to Bomb Calls</h2>
    <h3>416.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this policy is to provide guidelines to assist members of the Metro Transit Police Department in their initial response to incidents involving explosives, explosive devices, explosion/ bombing incidents or threats of such incidents.
        Under no circumstances should these guidelines be interpreted as compromising the safety of first responders or the public. When confronted with an incident involving explosives, safety should always be the primary consideration.</p>

    <h3>416.2 POLICY</h3>
    <p>It is the policy of the Metro Transit Police Department to place a higher priority on the safety of persons and the public over damage or destruction to public or private property.</p>

    <h3>416.3 RECEIPT OF BOMB THREAT</h3>
    <p>Department members receiving a bomb threat should obtain as much information from the individual as reasonably possible, including the type, placement and alleged detonation time of the device.</p>
    <p>If the bomb threat is received on a recorded line, reasonable steps should be taken to ensure that the recording is preserved in accordance with established department evidence procedures.</p>
    <p>The member receiving the bomb threat should ensure that the Shift Supervisor is immediately advised and informed of the details. This will enable the Shift Supervisor to ensure that the appropriate personnel are dispatched and, as appropriate, the
        threatened location is given an advance warning.</p>

    <h3>416.4 GOVERNMENT FACILITY OR PROPERTY</h3>
    <p>A bomb threat targeting a government facility may require a different response based on the government agency.</p>
    <h4>416.4.1 METRO TRANSIT POLICE DEPARTMENT FACILITY</h4>
    <p>If the bomb threat is against the Metro Transit Police Department facility, the Shift Supervisor will direct and assign officers as required for coordinating a general building search or evacuation of the police department, as he/she deems appropriate.</p>
    <h4>416.4.2 OTHER COUNTY OR MUNICIPAL FACILITY OR PROPERTY</h4>
    <p>If the bomb threat is against a county or municipal facility within the jurisdiction of the Metro Transit Police Department that is not the property of this department, the appropriate agency will be promptly informed of the threat. Assistance to
        the other entity may be provided as the Shift Supervisor deems appropriate.</p>
    <h4>416.4.3 FEDERAL BUILDING OR PROPERTY</h4>
    <p>If the bomb threat is against a federal building or property, the Federal Protective Service should be immediately notified. The Federal Protective Service provides a uniformed law enforcement response for most facilities, which may include use of
        its Explosive Detector Dog teams.</p>
    <p>If the bomb threat is against a federal government property where the Federal Protective Service is unable to provide a timely response, the appropriate facility’s security or command staff should be notified.</p>
    <p>Bomb threats against a military installation should be reported to the military police or other military security responsible for the installation.</p>

    <h3>416.5 PRIVATE FACILITY OR PROPERTY</h3>
    <p>When a member of this department receives notification of a bomb threat at a Metropolitan Council / Metro Transit location, the member receiving the notification should obtain as much information as reasonably possible from the notifying individual,
        including:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>The location of the facility.</li>
        <li>The nature of the threat.</li>
        <li>Whether the type and detonation time of the device is known.</li>
        <li>Whether the facility is occupied, and if so, the number of occupants currently on-scene.</li>
        <li>Whether the individual is requesting police assistance at the facility.</li>
        <li>Whether there are any internal facility procedures regarding bomb threats in place, such as:
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>No evacuation of personnel and no search for a device.</li>
                <li>Search for a device without evacuation of personnel.</li>
                <li>Evacuation of personnel without a search for a device.</li>
                <li>Evacuation of personnel and a search for a device.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>The member receiving the bomb threat information should ensure that the Shift Supervisor is immediately notified so that he/she can communicate with the person in charge of the threatened facility.</p>
    <h4>416.5.1 ASSISTANCE</h4>
    <p>The Shift Supervisor should be notified when police assistance is requested. The Shift Supervisor will make the decision whether the Department will render assistance and at what level. Information and circumstances that indicate a reasonably apparent,
        imminent threat to the safety of either the facility or the public may require a more active approach, including police control over the facility.</p>
    <p>Should the Shift Supervisor determine that the Department will assist or control such an incident, he/she will determine:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>The appropriate level of assistance.</li>
        <li>The plan for assistance.</li>
        <li>Whether to evacuate and/or search the facility.</li>
        <li>Whether to involve facility staff in the search or evacuation of the building.</p>
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>The person in charge of the facility should be made aware of the possibility of damage to the facility as a result of a search.</li>
                <li>The safety of all participants is the paramount concern.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>The need for additional resources, including:</p>
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>Notification and response, or standby notice, for fire and emergency medical services.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Even though a facility does not request police assistance to clear the interior of a building, based upon the circumstances and known threat, officers may be sent to the scene to evacuate other areas that could be affected by the type of threat, or
        for traffic and pedestrian control.</p>

    <h3>416.6 FOUND DEVICE</h3>
    <p>When handling an incident involving a suspected explosive device, the following guidelines, while not all inclusive, should be followed:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>No known or suspected explosive item should be considered safe regardless of its size or apparent packaging.</li>
        <li>The device should not be touched or moved except by the bomb squad or military explosive ordnance disposal team.</li>
        <li>Personnel should not transmit on any equipment that is capable of producing radio frequency energy within the evacuation area around the suspected device. This includes the following:
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>Two-way radios</li>
                <li>Cell phones</li>
                <li>Other personal communication devices</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>The appropriate bomb squad or military explosive ordnance disposal team should be summoned for assistance.</li>
        <li>The largest perimeter reasonably possible should initially be established around the device based upon available personnel and the anticipated danger zone.</li>
        <li>A safe access route should be provided for support personnel and equipment.</li>
        <li>Search the area for secondary devices as appropriate and based upon available resources.</li>
        <li>Consider evacuation of buildings and personnel near the device or inside the danger zone and the safest exit route.</li>
        <li>Promptly relay available information to the Shift Supervisor including:</p>
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>The time of discovery.</li>
                <li>The exact location of the device.</li>
                <li>A full description of the device (e.g., size, shape, markings, construction).</li>
                <li>The anticipated danger zone and perimeter.</li>
                <li>The areas to be evacuated or cleared.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>416.7 EXPLOSION/BOMBING INCIDENTS</h3>
    <p>When an explosion has occurred, there are multitudes of considerations which may confront the responding officers. As in other catastrophic events, a rapid response may help to minimize injury to victims, minimize contamination of the scene by gathering
        crowds, or minimize any additional damage from fires or unstable structures.</p>
    <h4>416.7.1 CONSIDERATIONS</h4>
    <p>Officers responding to explosions, whether accidental or a criminal act, should consider the following actions:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Assess the scope of the incident, including the number of victims and extent of injuries.
            <li>Request additional personnel and resources, as appropriate.</li>
            <li>Assist with first aid.</li>
            <li>Identify and take appropriate precautions to mitigate scene hazards, such as collapsed structures, bloodborne pathogens and hazardous materials.</li>
            <li>Assist with the safe evacuation of victims, if possible.</li>
            <li>Establish an inner perimeter to include entry points and evacuation routes. Search for additional or secondary devices.</li>
            <li>Preserve evidence.</li>
            <li>Establish an outer perimeter and evacuate if necessary.</li>
            <li>Identify witnesses.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>416.7.2 NOTIFICATIONS</h4>
    <p>When an explosion has occurred, the following people should be notified as appropriate:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Fire department</li>
        <li>Bomb squad</li>
        <li>Additional department personnel, such as investigators and forensic services</li>
        <li>Field supervisor</li>
        <li>Shift Supervisor</li>
        <li>Other<span> law enforcement agencies, including local, state or federal agencies, such as the FBI and the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF)</span></li>
        <li>Other government agencies, as appropriate</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>416.7.3 CROWD CONTROL</h4>
    <p>Only authorized members with a legitimate need should be permitted access to the scene. Spectators and other unauthorized individuals should be restricted to a safe distance as is reasonably practicable given the available resources and personnel.</p>
    <h4>416.7.4 PRESERVATION OF EVIDENCE</h4>
    <p>As in any other crime scene, steps should immediately be taken to preserve the scene. The Shift Supervisor should assign officers to protect the crime scene area, which could extend over a long distance. Consideration should be given to the fact that
        evidence may be imbedded in nearby structures or hanging in trees and bushes.</p>

    <h2>418 -  Civil Commitments</h2>
    <h3>418.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>This policy provides guidelines for when officers may place an individual in protective custody and request a 72-hour hold under the Minnesota Commitment and Treatment Act (Minn. Stat. § 253B.05).</p>

    <h3>418.2 POLICY</h3>
    <p>It is the policy of the Metro Transit Police Department to protect the public and individuals through legal and appropriate use of the 72-hour hold process.</p>

    <h3>418.3 AUTHORITY</h3>
    <p>An officer, having reason to believe that any individual because of mental illness, chemical dependency or public intoxication is in danger of injuring him/herself or others if not immediately detained, may take, or cause to be taken, the individual
        to a treatment facility for a 72-hour evaluation (Minn. Stat. § 253B.05, Subd. 2).</p>
    <p>The officer shall make written application for admission of the individual to a treatment facility. The application shall contain the officer’s reasons for and circumstances under which the individual was taken into custody. If danger to specific
        individuals is a basis for the requested emergency hold, the statement must include identifying information for those individuals to the extent reasonably practicable. The facility shall make a copy of the statement available to the individual
        taken into custody (Minn. Stat. § 253B.05, Subd. 2).</p>
    <h4>418.3.1 VOLUNTARY EVALUATION</h4>
    <p>If officers encounter an individual who may qualify for a 72-hour hold, they may inquire as to whether the person desires to voluntarily be evaluated at an appropriate facility. If the individual so desires, the officers should:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Transport the individual to an appropriate facility that is able to conduct the evaluation and admit the person pursuant to the Minnesota Commitment and Treatment Act.</li>
        <li>If at any point the individual changes his/her mind regarding voluntary evaluation, officers should proceed with the application for a 72-hour hold, if appropriate.</li>
        <li>Document the circumstances surrounding the individual’s desire to pursue voluntary evaluation and/or admission.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>418.4 CONSIDERATIONS AND RESPONSIBILITIES</h3>
    <p>Any officer handling a call involving an individual who may qualify for a 72-hour hold should consider, as time and circumstances reasonably permit:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Available information that might assist in determining the cause and nature of the individual’s action or stated intentions.
        </li>
        <li>Community or neighborhood mediation services.</li>
        <li>Conflict resolution and de-escalation techniques.</li>
        <li>Community or other resources available to assist in dealing with mental health issues.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>While these steps are encouraged, nothing in this section is intended to dissuade officers from taking reasonable action to ensure the safety of the officers and others.</p>

    <h3>418.5 TRANSPORTATION</h3>
    <p>When transporting any individual for a 72-hour hold, the transporting officer should have Transit Control Center notify the receiving facility of the estimated time of arrival, the level of cooperation of the individual and whether any special medical
        care is needed.</p>
    <p>Officers may transport individuals in a patrol unit and shall secure them in accordance with the Handcuffing and Restraints Policy. Should the detainee require transport in a medical transport vehicle and the safety of any person, including the detainee,
        requires the presence of an officer during the transport, Shift Supervisor approval is required before transport commences.</p>
    <h4>418.5.1 TYPE OF TRANSPORTATION</h4>
    <p>When transporting any individual on a Minn. Stat. § 253B.05 admission, and if reasonably practicable, officers should not be in uniform and should not use a vehicle visibly marked as a law enforcement vehicle (Minn. Stat. § 253B.05, Subd. 2(b)).</p>

    <h3>418.6 TRANSFER TO APPROPRIATE FACILITY</h3>
    <p>Upon arrival at the facility, the officer will escort the individual into a treatment area designated by a facility staff member. If the individual is not seeking treatment voluntarily, the officer should provide the staff member with the written
        application for a 72-hour hold and remain present to provide clarification of the grounds for detention, upon request.</p>
    <p>Absent exigent circumstances, the transporting officer should not assist facility staff with the admission process, including restraint of the individual. However, if the individual is transported and delivered while restrained, the officer may assist
        with transferring the individual to facility restraints and will be available to assist during the admission process, if requested. Under normal circumstances, officers will not apply facility-ordered restraints.</p>

    <h3>418.7 DOCUMENTATION</h3>
    <p>The officer should complete an application for emergency admission, provide it to the facility staff member assigned to that patient and retain a copy of the application for inclusion in the case report.</p>
    <p>The officer should also provide a verbal summary to any evaluating staff member regarding the circumstances leading to the involuntary detention.</p>

    <h3>418.8 CRIMINAL OFFENSES</h3>
    <p>Officers investigating an individual who is suspected of committing a minor criminal offense and who is being taken into custody for purposes of a 72-hour hold should resolve the criminal matter by issuing a warning or a citation, as appropriate.</p>
    <p>When an individual who may qualify for a 72-hour hold has committed a serious criminal offense that would normally result in an arrest and transfer to a jail facility, the officer should:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Arrest the individual when there is probable cause to do so.</li>
        <li>Notify the appropriate supervisor of the facts supporting the arrest and the facts that would support the 72-hour hold.</li>
        <li>Facilitate the individual’s transfer to jail.</li>
        <li>Thoroughly document in the related reports the circumstances that indicate the individual may qualify for a 72-hour hold.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>In the supervisor’s judgment, the individual may be arrested or booked and transported to the appropriate mental health facility. The supervisor should consider the seriousness of the offense, the treatment options available, the ability of this department
        to regain custody of the individual, department resources (e.g., posting a guard) and other relevant factors in making this decision.</p>

    <h3>418.9 FIREARMS AND OTHER WEAPONS</h3>
    <p>Whenever an individual is taken into custody for a 72-hour hold, the handling officers should seek to determine if the individual owns or has access to any firearm or other deadly weapon. Officers should consider whether it is appropriate and consistent
        with current search and seizure law under the circumstances to seize any such firearms or other dangerous weapons (e.g., safekeeping, evidence, consent).</p>
    <p>Officers are cautioned that a search warrant may be needed before entering a residence or other place to search unless lawful warrantless entry has already been made (e.g., exigent circumstances, consent). A warrant may also be needed before searching
        for or seizing weapons.</p>
    <p>The handling officers should further advise the individual of the procedure for the return of any firearm or other weapon that has been taken into custody.</p>

    <h3>418.10 TRAINING</h3>
    <p>This department will endeavor to provide department-approved training on interaction with mentally disabled persons, 72-hour holds and crisis intervention.</p>

            <div class="chapter" id="420">
    <h2>420 - Cite and Release Policy</h2>
    <h3>420.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this policy is to provide members of the Metro Transit Police Department with guidance on when to release adults who are suspected offenders on a citation for a criminal offense, rather than having the person held in custody for a court
        appearance or released on bail.</p>
    <p>This policy also provides guidance on when a court orders that a person be released.</p>
    <p>Additional release restrictions may apply to those detained for domestic violence, as outlined in the Domestic Abuse Policy.</p>

    <h3>420.2 POLICY</h3>
    <p>The Metro Transit Police Department will consider its resources and its mission of protecting the community when exercising any discretion to release suspected offenders on a citation, when authorized to do so.</p>

    <h3>420.3 RELEASE</h3>
    <p>A suspected offender shall be released on issuance of a citation:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">

            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>Release is not required if a reviewing supervisor determines that the offender should be held pursuant to Minn. R. Crim. P. 6.01 Subd. 1.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>When the offender is charged with a petty or fine-only misdemeanor (Minn. R. Crim. P. 6.01).</li>
        <li>In misdemeanor cases unless it reasonably appears to the arresting officer that the offender will (Minn. R. Crim. P. 6.01):
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>Cause bodily injury to him/herself or another if he/she is not detained.</li>
                <li>Continue engaging in criminal conduct.</li>

            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>When the offender is from another state which has a reciprocal agreement with Minnesota unless the offense is (Minn. Stat. § 169.91):</p>
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>One which would result in the revocation of the offender’s driver’s license under Minnesota law upon conviction.</li>
                <li>A violation of a highway weight limitation.</li>
                <li>A violation of a law governing the transportation of hazardous materials.</li>
                <li>That the offender was driving without a valid driver’s license.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>420.4 PROHIBITIONS</h3>
    <p>The release of a suspected offender on a citation is not permitted when:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>The offender has committed a driving while impaired (DWI) offense (Minn. Stat. § 169A.40; Minn. Stat. § 169.91).</li>
        <li>The offender is arrested for a violation of state law or an ordinance related to the operation or registration of a vehicle punishable as a misdemeanor or felony and (Minn. Stat. § 169.91):</p>
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>The offender demands an immediate appearance before a judge.</li>
                <li>The offender is charged with:
                    <ol class="alpha">

                        <li>Failure to stop after being involved in an accident that resulted in death, personal injuries or damage to property.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>There is reasonable cause to believe that the offender may leave the state. See the Domestic Abuse Policy for release restrictions related to those investigations.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>420.5 CONSIDERATIONS</h3>
    <p>In determining whether to cite and release a person when discretion is permitted, officers should consider:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>The type of offense committed.</li>
        <li>The known criminal history of the suspected offender.</li>
        <li>The ability to identify the suspected offender with reasonable certainty.</li>
        <li>Whether there is any record of the individual failing to appear in previous cases or other articulable indications that the individual may not appear in court for this offense.</li>
        <li>The individual’s ties to the area, such as residence, employment or family.</li>
        <li>Whether there is reasonable likelihood that criminal conduct by the individual will continue.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>420.6 FISH AND GAME AND ENVIRONMENT-RELATED OFFENSES</h3>
    <p>In the case of game and fish laws or other environment-related offenses, as specified in Minn. Stat. § 97A.211, officers should release the offender unless there is reason to believe that criminal conduct will continue or that the offender will not
        respond as required by the citation (Minn. Stat. § 97A.211).</p>

    <h2>422 - Foreign Diplomatic and Consular Representatives</h2>
    <h3>422.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>This policy provides guidelines to ensure that members of the Metro Transit Police Department extend appropriate privileges and immunities to foreign diplomatic and consular representatives in accordance with international law.</p>

    <h3>422.2 POLICY</h3>
    <p>The Metro Transit Police Department respects international laws related to the special privileges and immunities afforded foreign diplomatic and consular representatives assigned to the United States.</p>
    <p>All foreign diplomatic and consular representatives shall be treated with respect and courtesy, regardless of any privileges or immunities afforded them.</p>

    <h3>422.3 CLAIMS OF IMMUNITY</h3>
    <p>If a member comes into contact with a person where law enforcement action may be warranted and the person claims diplomatic or consular privileges and immunities, the member should, without delay:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Notify a supervisor.</li>
        <li>Advise the person that his/her claim will be investigated and he/she may be released in accordance with the law upon confirmation of the person’s status.</li>
        <li>Request the person’s identification card, either issued by the U.S. Department of State (DOS), Office of the Chief of Protocol, or in the case of persons accredited to the United Nations, by the U.S. Mission to the United Nations. These are the
            only reliable documents for purposes of determining privileges and immunities.</li>

    </ol>
    <p>Identity or immunity status should not be presumed from the type of license plates displayed on a vehicle. If there is a question as to the status or the legitimate possession of a Diplomat or Consul license plate, a query should be run via the National
        Law Enforcement Telecommunications System (NLETS), designating “US” as the state.</p>

    <h3>422.4 ENFORCEMENT ACTION</h3>
    <p>If the DOS is not immediately available for consultation regarding law enforcement action, members shall be aware of the following:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">

        <li>All persons, even those with a valid privilege or immunity, may be reasonably restrained in exigent circumstances for purposes of self-defense, public safety or the prevention of serious criminal acts.</li>
        <li>An impaired foreign diplomatic or consular representative may be prevented from driving a vehicle, even if the person may not be arrested due to privileges and immunities.</p>
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>Investigations, including the request for field sobriety tests, chemical tests and any other tests regarding impaired driving may proceed but they shall not be compelled.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>The following persons may not be detained or arrested, and any property or vehicle owned by these persons may not be searched or seized:

    <h2>424 - Rapid Response and Deployment Policy</h2>
    <h3>424.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>Violence in schools, workplaces and other locations by any individual or group of individuals presents a difficult situation for law enforcement. The purpose of this policy is to identify guidelines and factors that will assist officers implement
        rapid response and deployment to such situations.</p>

    <h3>424.2 POLICY</h3>
    <p>The policy of this department in dealing with a crisis situation shall be:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>To obtain and maintain complete operative control of the incident.</li>
        <li>To explore every reasonably available source of intelligence regarding the circumstances, location and suspect(s) in the incident.</li>
        <li>To attempt, by every means available, to attain any tactical advantage over the responsible individual(s).</li>
        <li>To attempt, whenever feasible, a negotiated surrender of the suspect(s) and release of the hostages through the expertise of the members of this department and others.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Nothing in this policy shall preclude the use of necessary force, deadly or otherwise, by members of this department in protecting themselves or others from death or injury.</p>

    <h3>424.3 PROCEDURE</h3>
    <p>If there is a reasonable belief that acts or threats by a suspect are placing lives in imminent danger, first responding officers should consider reasonable options to immediately eliminate the threat. Officers must decide, often under a multitude
        of difficult and rapidly evolving circumstances, whether to advance on the suspect, take other actions to deal with the threat or wait for additional resources.</p>
    <p>When deciding on a course of action officers should consider the following:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Whether sufficient personnel are available on-scene to advance on the suspect. Any advance on a suspect should be made using teams of two or more officers whenever reasonably possible.</li>
        <li>Whether individuals who are under imminent threat can be moved out of danger with reasonable safety.</li>
        <li>Whether the officers have the ability to effectively communicate with others in the field.</li>
        <li>Whether planned tactics can be effectively deployed.</li>
        <li>The availability of rifles, shotguns, shields, control devices and any other appropriate tools, and whether the deployment of these tools will provide a tactical advantage.</li>
        <li>In a case of a barricaded suspect with no hostages and no immediate threat to others, officers should consider summoning and waiting for additional assistance (special tactics and/or hostage negotiation team response).</li>
        <li>If a suspect is actively engaged in the infliction of serious bodily harm or other life-threatening activity toward others, the officer should take immediate action, if reasonably possible, to stop the threat presented by the suspect while calling
            for additional assistance.</li>

    <h2>428 - Immigration Violations</h2>
    <h3>428.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this policy is to provide guidelines to members of the Metro Transit Police Department for investigating and enforcing immigration laws.</p>

    <h3>428.2 POLICY</h3>
    <p>It is the policy of the Metro Transit Police Department that all members make personal and professional commitments to equal enforcement of the law and equal service to the public. Confidence in this commitment will increase the effectiveness of this
        department in protecting and serving the entire community and recognizing the dignity of all persons, regardless of their immigration status.</p>

    <h3>428.3 VICTIMS AND WITNESSES</h3>
    <p>To encourage crime reporting and cooperation in the investigation of criminal activity, all individuals, regardless of their immigration status, must feel secure that contacting or being addressed by members of law enforcement will not automatically
        lead to immigration inquiry and/ or deportation. While it may be necessary to determine the identity of a victim or witness, members shall treat all individuals equally and without regard to race, color or national origin in any way that would
        violate the United States or Minnesota Constitutions.</p>

    <h3>428.4 ENFORCEMENT</h3>
    <p>An officer may detain an individual when there are facts supporting a reasonable suspicion that the individual entered into the United States in violation of a federal criminal law. Federal authorities shall be notified as soon as possible and the
        detained individual shall be immediately released if the federal authorities do not want the person held. An officer should not detain any individual, for any length of time, for a civil violation of federal immigration laws or a related civil
        warrant.</p>
    <h4>428.4.1 CIVIL VS. CRIMINAL FEDERAL OFFENSES</h4>
    <p>An individual who enters into the United States illegally has committed a misdemeanor (8 USC</p>
    <p>§ 1325(a)). Generally, an alien who initially made a legal entry into the United States but has remained beyond what is a legal period of time has committed a federal civil offense.</p>
    <p>Reasonable suspicion that a criminal immigration violation has occurred shall not be based on race, color, national origin or any other generalization that would cast suspicion on or stigmatize any person, except to the extent permitted by the United
        States or Minnesota Constitutions. Instead, the totality of circumstances shall be used to determine reasonable suspicion, and shall include factors weighing for and against reasonable suspicion.</p>
    <p>Factors that may be considered in determining reasonable suspicion that a criminal immigration violation has occurred may include, but are not limited to:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>An admission that the person entered the United States illegally.</li>
        <li>Reason to suspect that the person possesses immigration documentation that is forged, altered or otherwise indicative that the person is not legally present in the United States.</li>
        <li>While a lack of English proficiency may be considered, it should not be the sole factor in establishing reasonable suspicion. When practicable, reasonable effort should be made to accommodate persons with limited English proficiency.</li>
        <li>Other factors based upon training and experience.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>428.4.2 IMMIGRATION CHECKS</h4>
    <p>Immigration status may be determined through any of the following sources:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>A law enforcement officer who is authorized by the federal government under 8 USC § 1357 to verify or ascertain an alien's immigration status (sometimes referred to as a 287(g) certified officer)</li>
        <li>Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE)</li>
        <li>U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>An officer shall verify from a 287(g) certified officer, ICE or CBP whether a person’s presence in the United States relates to a federal civil violation or a criminal violation.</p>
    <p>If the officer has facts that establish probable cause to believe that a person already lawfully detained has committed a criminal immigration offense, he/she may continue the detention and may request ICE or CBP to respond to the location to take
        custody of the detained person. In addition, the officer should notify a supervisor as soon as practicable. No individual who is otherwise ready to be released should continue to be detained only because questions about the individual’s status
        are unresolved.</p>
    <p>An officer is encouraged to forgo detentions made solely on the basis of a misdemeanor offense when time limitations, availability of personnel, issues of officer safety, communication capabilities or the potential to obstruct a separate investigation
        outweigh the need for the detention.</p>
    <h4>428.4.3 SUPERVISOR RESPONSIBILITIES</h4>
    <p>When notified that an officer has detained a person and established probable cause to believe the person has violated a criminal immigration offense, the supervisor should:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Confirm that the detained person’s immigration status was properly verified.</li>
        <li>Ensure that the detained person is taken into custody when appropriate. Take any additional steps necessary that may include, but are not limited to:</p>
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>Transfer to federal authorities.</li>
                <li>Lawful arrest for a criminal offense or warrant.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>428.5 ARREST NOTIFICATION TO IMMIGRATION AND CUSTOMS ENFORCEMENT</h3>
    <p>Generally, an officer will not need to notify ICE when booking arrestees at the county jail. Immigration officials routinely interview suspected undocumented aliens who are booked into the county jail on criminal charges. Notification will be handled
        according to jail operation procedures.</p>
    <p>No individual who is otherwise ready to be released should continue to be detained solely for the purpose of notification.</p>

    <h3>428.6 ICE REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE</h3>
    <p>Requests by ICE, or any other federal agency, for assistance from this department should be directed to a supervisor. The Department may provide available support services, such as traffic control or peacekeeping efforts, to ICE or other federal agencies.</p>

    <h3>428.7 INFORMATION SHARING</h3>
    <p>No member of this department will prohibit, or in any way restrict, any other member from doing any of the following regarding the citizenship or immigration status, lawful or unlawful, of any individual (8 USC § 1373):</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Sending information to, or requesting or receiving such information from ICE</li>
        <li>Maintaining such information in department records</li>
        <li>Exchanging such information with any other federal, state or local government entity</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>428.7.1 IMMIGRATION HOLDS</h4>
    <p>No individual should be held based solely on a federal immigration detainer under 8 CFR 287.7 unless the person has been charged with a federal crime or the detainer is accompanied by a warrant, affidavit of probable cause, or removal order. Notification
        to the federal authority issuing the detainer should be made prior to the release.</p>

    <h3>428.8 U VISA AND T VISA NON-IMMIGRANT STATUS</h3>
    <p>Under certain circumstances, federal law allows temporary immigration benefits, known as a U visa, to victims and witnesses of certain qualifying crimes (8 USC § 1101(a)(15)(U)). A law enforcement certification for a U visa may be completed by an
        officer in order for a U visa to be issued.</p>
    <p>Similar immigration protection, known as a T visa, is available for certain qualifying victims of human trafficking (8 USC § 1101(a)(15)(T)). A law enforcement declaration for a T visa may be completed by an officer in order for a T visa to be issued.</p>
    <p>Any request for assistance in applying for U visa or T visa status should be forwarded in a timely manner to the Investigation Division supervisor assigned to oversee the handling of any related case. The Investigation Division supervisor should:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Consult with the assigned investigator to determine the current status of any related case and whether further documentation is warranted.</li>
        <li>Contact the appropriate prosecutor assigned to the case, if applicable, to ensure the certification or declaration has not already been completed and whether a certification or declaration is warranted.</li>
        <li>Address the request and complete the certification or declaration, if appropriate, in a timely manner.
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>The instructions for completing certification and declaration forms can be found on the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) website.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Ensure that any decision to complete, or not complete, a certification or declaration form is documented in the case file and forwarded to the appropriate prosecutor. Include a copy of any completed form in the case file.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>428.9 TRAINING</h3>
    <p>The Training Supervisor shall ensure that all appropriate members receive immigration training.</p>

	<h2>437 - Obtaining Air Support</h2>
	<h3>437.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
	<p>The use of air support can be invaluable in certain situations. This policy specifies potential situations where the use of air support may be requested and the responsibilities for making a request.</p>

	<h3>437.2 REQUEST FOR AIR SUPPORT ASSISTANCE</h3>
	<p>If a supervisor or officer in charge of an incident determines that the use of air support would be beneficial, a request to obtain air support assistance may be made.</p>
	<h4>437.2.1 REQUEST FOR ASSISTANCE FROM ANOTHER AGENCY</h4>
	<p>After consideration and approval of the request for air support, the Shift Supervisor or designee will call the closest agency having air support available. The Shift Supervisor will apprise that agency of the specific details of the incident prompting
		the request.</p>
	<h3>437.2.2 CIRCUMSTANCES UNDER WHICH AID MAY BE REQUESTED</h4>
    <p>Law enforcement air support may be requested under any of the following conditions:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>When the aircraft is activated under existing mutual aid agreements.</li>
        <li>Whenever the safety of law enforcement personnel is in jeopardy and the presence of the aircraft may reduce such hazard.</li>
        <li>When the use of aircraft will aid in the capture of a suspected fleeing felon whose continued freedom represents an ongoing threat to the community.</li>
        <li>When an aircraft is needed to locate a person who has strayed or is lost and whose continued absence constitutes a serious health or safety hazard.</li>
        <li>Vehicle pursuits (Minn. Stat. § 626.8458).</li>
        <li>When the Shift Supervisor or equivalent authority determines a reasonable need exists.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>While it is recognized that the availability of air support will generally provide valuable assistance to ground personnel, the presence of air support will rarely replace the need for officers on the ground.</p>

            <div class="chapter" id="439">
    <h2>439 - Detentions and Photographing Detainees</h2>
    <h3>439.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this policy is to establish guidelines for conducting field interviews (FI) and pat- down searches, and the taking and retention of photographs of persons detained in the field but not arrested. Due to a variety of situations confronting
        the officer, the decision to FI or photograph a field detainee shall be left to the discretion of the involved officer based on the totality of the circumstances available to him/her at the time of the detention.</p>

    <h3>439.2 DEFINITIONS</h3>
    <p><strong>Detention</strong> - Occurs when an officer intentionally, through words, actions or physical force causes an individual to reasonably believe he/she is being required to restrict his/her movement. Detentions also occur when an officer actually
        restrains a person’s freedom of movement.</p>
    <p><strong>Consensual Encounter</strong> - Occurs when an officer contacts an individual but does not create a detention through words, actions or other means. In other words, a reasonable individual would believe that his/her contact with the officer
        is voluntary.</p>
    <p><strong>Field Interview (FI)</strong> - The brief detainment of an individual, whether on foot or in a vehicle, based on reasonable suspicion for the purpose of determining the individual's identity and resolving the officer's suspicions.></p>
    <p><strong>Field Photographs</strong> - Posed photographs taken of a person during a contact, detention or arrest in the field. Undercover surveillance photographs of an individual and recordings captured by the normal operation of a Mobile Video Recorder
        (MVR) system when persons are not posed for the purpose of photographing are not considered field photographs.</p>
    <p><strong>Pat-Down Search</strong> - This type of search is used by officers in the field to check an individual for weapons. It involves a thorough patting down of clothing to locate any weapons or dangerous items that could pose a danger to the officer,
        the detainee or others.</p>
    <p><strong>Reasonable Suspicion</strong> - Occurs when, under the totality of the circumstances, an officer has articulable facts that criminal activity may be afoot and a particular person is connected with that possible criminal activity.</p>

    <h3>439.3 FIELD INTERVIEWS</h3>
    <p>Officers may stop individuals for the purpose of conducting an FI where reasonable suspicion is present. In justifying the stop, the officer should be able to point to specific facts which, when taken together with rational inferences, reasonably
        warrant the stop. Such facts include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>The appearance or demeanor of an individual suggests that he/she is part of a criminal enterprise or is engaged in a criminal act.</li>
        <li>The actions of the suspect suggest that he/she is engaged in a criminal activity.</li>
        <li>The hour of day or night is inappropriate for the suspect's presence in the area.</li>
        <li>The suspect's presence in the particular area is suspicious.</li>
        <li>The suspect is carrying a suspicious object.</li>
        <li>The suspect's clothing bulges in a manner that suggests he/she is carrying a weapon.</li>
        <li>The suspect is located in proximate time and place to an alleged crime.</li>
        <li>The officer has knowledge of the suspect's prior criminal record or involvement in criminal activity.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>439.3.1 INITIATING A FIELD INTERVIEW</h4>
    <p>Based on observance of suspicious circumstances or upon information from investigation, an officer may initiate the stop of a person when there is articulable, reasonable suspicion to do so. A person, however, should not be detained longer than is
        reasonably necessary to resolve the officer’s suspicions.</p>
    <p>Nothing in this policy is intended to discourage consensual contacts. Frequent and random casual contacts with consenting individuals is encouraged by the Metro Transit Police Department to strengthen our community involvement, community awareness
        and problem identification.</p>
    <h4>439.3.2 DURATION OF DETENTION</h4>
    <p>A subject may be detained to conduct an FI only for the period reasonably necessary to determine the individual’s identity and resolve the officer’s suspicions. The interview should not extend beyond the immediate vicinity of the place where the detention
        was first effected unless the detainee is arrested.</p>
    <h4>439.3.3 WITNESS IDENTIFICATION AND INTERVIEWS</h4>
    <p>Because potential witnesses to an incident may be lost or the integrity of their statements compromised with the passage of time, officers should, when warranted by the seriousness of the case, take reasonable steps to promptly coordinate with an
        on-scene supervisor and/or criminal investigator to utilize available personnel for the following:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Identifying all persons present at the scene and in the immediate area.
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>When reasonably feasible, a recorded statement should be obtained from those persons who claim not to have witnessed the incident but who were present at the time it occurred.</li>
                <li>Any potential witness who is unwilling or unable to remain available for a formal interview should not be detained absent reasonable suspicion to detain or probable cause to arrest. Without detaining the individual for the sole purpose
                    of identification, officers should attempt to identify the witness prior to his/her departure.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Witnesses who are willing to provide a formal interview should be asked to meet at a suitable location where criminal investigators may obtain a recorded statement. Such witnesses, if willing, may be transported by department personnel.
            <ol>
                <li>A written, verbal or recorded statement of consent should be obtained prior to transporting a witness in a department vehicle. When the witness is a minor, consent should be obtained from the parent or guardian, if reasonably available,
                    prior to transport.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>439.4 PAT-DOWN SEARCHES</h3>
    <p>A pat-down search of a detained subject may be conducted whenever an officer reasonably believes that the person may possess an object that can be utilized as an offensive weapon or whenever the officer has a reasonable fear for his/her own safety
        or the safety of others. Circumstances that may establish justification for performing a pat-down search include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
    <ol class="alphs">
        <li>The type of crime suspected, particularly in crimes of violence where the use or threat of weapons is involved.</li>
        <li>Where more than one suspect must be handled by a single officer.</li>
        <li>The hour of the day and the location or area where the stop takes place.</li>
        <li>Prior knowledge of the suspect's use of force and/or propensity to carry weapons.</li>
        <li>The appearance and demeanor of the suspect.</li>
        <li>Visual indications that suggest the suspect is carrying a firearm or other weapon.</li>
        <li>The age and gender of the suspect.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>When reasonably possible, pat-down searches should be performed by officers of the same gender as the suspect.</p>

    <h3>439.5 FIELD PHOTOGRAPHS</h3>
    <p>Before photographing any field detainee, the officer shall carefully consider, among other things, the factors listed below.</p>
    <h4>439.5.1 FIELD PHOTOGRAPHS TAKEN WITH CONSENT</h4>
    <p>Field photographs may be taken when the subject of the photograph knowingly and voluntarily gives consent. When taking a consensual photograph, the officer should note in a report that the subject consented to the photograph being taken.</p>
    <h4>439.5.2 FIELD PHOTOGRAPHS TAKEN WITHOUT CONSENT</h4>
    <p>Field photographs may be taken without consent only if they are taken during a detention that is based upon reasonable suspicion of criminal activity, and the photograph serves a legitimate law enforcement purpose related to the detention. The officer
        must be able to articulate facts that reasonably indicate that the subject was involved in or was about to become involved in criminal conduct.</p>
    <p>If, prior to taking a photograph, the officer’s reasonable suspicion of criminal activity has been dispelled, the detention must cease and the photograph should not be taken.</p>
    <p>All field photographs and related reports shall be submitted to a supervisor and retained in compliance with this policy.</p>

    <h3>439.6 SUPERVISOR RESPONSIBILITIES</h3>
    <p>While it is recognized that field photographs often become valuable investigative tools, supervisors should monitor such practices in view of the above listed considerations. This is not to imply that supervisor approval is required before taking
        each photograph. Field photographs shall be classified as law enforcement data under Minn. Stat. § 13.82, and shall be collected, maintained and disseminated consistent with the Minnesota Government Data Practices Act.</p>

    <h3>439.7 DISPOSITION OF PHOTOGRAPHS</h3>
    <p>All detainee photographs must be adequately labeled and submitted to the Shift Supervisor with either an associated FI card or other memorandum explaining the nature of the contact. If an individual is photographed as a suspect in a particular crime,
        the photograph should be submitted as an evidence item in the related case, following standard evidence procedures.</p>
    <p>If a photograph is not associated with an investigation where a case number has been issued, the Shift Supervisor should review and forward the photograph to one of the following locations:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>If the photo and associated FI or memorandum is relevant to criminal gang enforcement, the Shift Supervisor will forward the photo and documents to the Investigations Supervisor. The Investigations Supervisor will ensure the photograph and supporting
            documents are retained as prescribed in the Criminal Organizations Policy.</li>
        <li>Photographs that do not qualify for retention in the criminal gang file or that are not evidence in an investigation with an assigned case number should be forwarded to the Records Section. These photographs will be purged as described in this
            policy.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>When a photograph is taken in association with a particular case, the investigator may use such photograph in a photo lineup. Thereafter, the individual photograph should be retained as a part of the case file. All other photographs will be kept in
        the Records Section in a separate non-booking photograph file in alphabetical order.</p>
    <h4>439.7.1 PURGING THE FIELD PHOTO FILE</h4>
    <p>Photographs that are more than one year old and no longer serve a law enforcement purpose are periodically purged and destroyed unless a longer period of retention is required by the Department records retention schedule. No record may be destroyed
        unless done in compliance with such a schedule unless ordered by a court or pursuant to other applicable statute. Photographs that continue to serve a law enforcement purpose may be retained longer than one year provided that a notation of that
        fact is added to the file for each additional year that they are retained. Access to FI photos shall be governed by the Minnesota Government Data Practices Act.</p>

    <h3>439.8 PHOTO REVIEW POLICY</h3>
    <p>Any person who has been the subject of a field photograph or an FI by this department during any contact other than an arrest and requests to view non-confidential data shall be shown the data immediately if possible, or within 10 days of the date
        of the oral or written request, excluding Saturdays, Sundays and legal holidays. No charge may be assessed for display of the data, and if desired the person shall be informed of the content and meaning of that data (Minn. Stat. § 13.04 Subd.
        3). The request to view the photograph/FI data shall be directed to the office of the Chief of Police, who will ensure that the status of the photograph or FI is properly reviewed according to this policy as described below.</p>
    <h4>439.8.1 REVIEW PROCESS</h4>
    <p>Upon receipt of such a written request, the Chief of Police or designee will permit the individual to appear in person. Any minor should be accompanied by a parent or legal guardian for a review of the status of the photograph/Fl unless the minor
        has made a request that the photograph/FI not be reviewed by the parent or guardian pursuant to Minn. R. 1205.0500.</p>
    <p>Such a meeting will be scheduled during regular business hours no longer than 10 days of the receipt of the request.</p>
    <p>A meeting for the review of the status of any non-arrest photograph/FI is simply an informal opportunity for the individual to meet to review the data.</p>

    <h2>440 - Photography of Metropolitan Council / Metro Transit Property</h2>
    <h3>440.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>The Metropolitan Council / Metro Transit (herein referred to as "Council") has security and public relations interests in persons wishing to take photographic or video images on, in or of Council property, vehicles and/or employees. Although in most
        cases there is no particular harm involved in taking photographic or video images on, in or of Council property, vehicles or employees, intelligence indicates that persons who wish to target particular locations for terrorist purposes are likely
        to use photography as part of their pre-attack surveillance and planning. As such, the Council has not only an obligation to protect its customers, employees, property and to deter and prevent terrorism, but also an inherent responsibility to
        regulate photography on, in or of Council property, vehicles and employees.</p>

    <h3>440.2 POLICY</h3>
    <p>In order to provide the highest level of security to its customers and employees, the Council requires that any person on or in Council property or vehicles taking non-commercial/personal use photographic or video images, including but not limited
        to, film, digital or video recording (hereinafter referred to as "pictures") of Council property, vehicles and/or employees, must provide proper identification upon request of a Metro Transit Police officer.</p>
    <p>Any person observed taking pictures on, in or of Council property, vehicles and/or employees who refuses to provide proper identification to a Metro Transit Police officer or other Council official upon request; or any person observed taking pictures
        on, in or of a restricted area (i.e. an area not open to the public) will be directed to stop taking pictures and will be subject to additional law enforcement action as appropriate.</p>
    <p>Any person wishing to take pictures for any type of commercial purpose or use (e.g. movies, commercials, trade publications etc.) must first obtain permission from the Council Marketing Department.</p>

    <h3>440.3 TYPES OF PHOTOGRAPHY</h3>
    <p>Photography of Council property will typically fall into one of the following three categories:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Non-Commercial / Personal Use Photography
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>No permission is required for non-commercial / personal use pictures taken in public areas. However, any person taking pictures on, in or of Council property, vehicles and/or employees must provide proper identification (preferably in
                    the form of state issued identification) upon request of a Metro Transit Police officer or other Council official. The Metro Transit Police officer or Council official may allow the person to take pictures at the specific location
                    under the following conditions:
                    <ol class="alpha">
                        <li>The person provides proper identification.</li>
                        <li>The circumstances indicate that the subject(s) of the picture(s) does/do not pose a security or safety threat or in any way cause disruption of service or operations of the Council; and</li>
                        <li>The picture(s) is/are for personal or educational use only (e.g. tourist, railroad buff, student, artist etc).</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>Non-commercial / personal use photographers are prohibited from using tripods, monopods, wiring or any like equipment that may have an impact on the safety of customers and/or employees and are prohibited from interfering with the free
                    flow of passengers or disrupting service in any manner.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Commercial Photography
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>Any person wishing to take pictures for any type of commercial purpose or use must first obtain permission from the Metropolitan Council / Metro Transit Marketing Department located at: 560 6th Ave N in the City of Minneapolis, Minnesota
                    55411 or by calling (612) 349-7525. If permission is granted, it will be valid for a specific location, date and time.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>News Media Photography
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>News media photographers shall display their Press credentials and will be allowed to take pictures in the public areas on, in or of Council property, vehicles and/or employees so long as they do not interfere with the free flow of passengers
                    or disrupt service in any manner.</li>
                <li>News media photographers are requested to make prior notification to the Metropolitan Council / Metro Transit - Public Information Officer at (612) 373-3333 and to the Metro Transit Police Department at (612) 349-7200.</li>
                <li>News media photographers are not allowed inside any crime or incident scene without the permission of, and an escort provided by, the on-scene Metro Transit Police Incident Commander or their designee.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>440.4 DOCUMENTING PHOTOGRAPHY INCIDENTS</h3>
    <p>All Metro Transit Police officers operating within the scope of this policy will document all incidents on the appropriate Metro Transit Police report form(s) and/or records management system. Officers may refer to the Report Preparation Policy if
        further information is needed.</p>
</div>
            <div class="chapter" id="441">
    <h2>441 - Criminal Gangs</h2>
    <h3>441.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this policy is to ensure that the Metro Transit Police Department appropriately utilizes criminal intelligence systems and temporary information files to support investigations of criminal organizations and enterprises.</p>
    <h4>441.1.1 DEFINITIONS</h4>
    <p>Definitions related to this policy include:</p>
    <p><strong>Criminal intelligence system</strong> - Any record system that receives, stores, exchanges or disseminates information that has been evaluated and determined to be relevant to the identification of a criminal organization or enterprise, its
        members or affiliates. This does not include temporary information files.</p>

    <h3>441.2 POLICY</h3>
    <p>The Metro Transit Police Department recognizes that certain criminal activities, including but not limited to gang crimes and drug trafficking, often involve some degree of regular coordination and may involve a large number of participants over a
        broad geographical area.</p>
    <p>It is the policy of this department to collect and share relevant information while respecting the privacy and legal rights of the public.</p>

    <h3>441.3 CRIMINAL INTELLIGENCE SYSTEMS</h3>
    <p>No department member may create, submit to or obtain information from a criminal intelligence system unless the Chief of Police has approved the system for department use.</p>
    <p>Any criminal intelligence system approved for department use should meet or exceed the standards of 28 CFR 23.20.</p>
    <p>A designated supervisor will be responsible for maintaining each criminal intelligence system that has been approved for department use. The supervisor or the authorized designee should ensure the following:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Members using any such system are appropriately selected and trained.</li>
        <li>Use of every criminal intelligence system is appropriately reviewed and audited.</li>
        <li>Any system security issues are reasonably addressed.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>441.3.1 SYSTEM ENTRIES</h4>
    <p>It is the designated supervisor’s responsibility to approve the entry of any information from a report, FI, photo or other relevant document into an authorized criminal intelligence system. If entries are made based upon information that is not on
        file with this department, such as open or public source documents or documents that are on file at another agency, the designated supervisor should ensure copies of those documents are retained by the Records Section. Any supporting documentation
        for an entry shall be retained by the Records Section in accordance with the established records retention schedule and for at least as long as the entry is maintained in the system.</p>
    <p>The designated supervisor should ensure that any documents retained by the Records Section are appropriately marked as intelligence information. The Records Supervisor may not purge such documents without the approval of the designated supervisor.</p>
    <h4>441.3.2 ENTRIES INTO CRIMINAL GANG INVESTIGATIVE DATA SYSTEM</h4>
    <p>It is the designated supervisor’s responsibility to approve the entry of any information into the criminal gang investigative data system maintained by the Minnesota Bureau of Criminal Apprehension and authorized by Minn. Stat. § 299C.091. Entries
        may be made if the individual is 14 years of age or older and the Department documents the following:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>The Department has reasonable suspicion to believe that the individual has met at least three of the criteria or identifying characteristics of gang membership, developed by the Violent Crime Coordinating Council.</li>
        <li>The individual has been convicted of a gross misdemeanor or felony, or has been adjudicated or has a stayed adjudication as a juvenile for an offense that would be a gross misdemeanor or felony if committed by an adult.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>441.4 TEMPORARY INFORMATION FILE</h3>
    <p>No member may create or keep files on individuals that are separate from the approved criminal intelligence system. However, members may maintain temporary information that is necessary to actively investigate whether a person or group qualifies for
        entry into the department-approved CIS only as provided in this section. Once information qualifies for inclusion, it should be submitted to the supervisor responsible for consideration of CIS entries.</p>
    <h4>441.4.1 FILE CONTENTS</h4>
    <p>A temporary information file may only contain information and documents that, within one year, will have a reasonable likelihood to meet the criteria for entry into an authorized criminal intelligence system.</p>
    <p>Information and documents contained in a temporary information file:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Must only be included upon documented authorization of the responsible department supervisor.</li>
        <li>Should not be originals that would ordinarily be retained by the Records Section or Property and Evidence, but should be copies of, or references to, retained documents such as copies of reports, field interview (FI) forms, Transit Control Center
            records or booking forms.</li>
        <li>Shall not include opinions. No person, organization or enterprise shall be labeled as being involved in crime beyond what is already in the document or information.</li>
        <li>May include information collected from publicly available sources or references to documents on file with another government agency. Attribution identifying the source should be retained with the information.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>441.4.2 FILE REVIEW AND PURGING</h4>
    <p>The contents of a temporary information file shall not be retained longer than one year. At the end of one year, the contents must be purged or entered in an authorized criminal intelligence system, as applicable.</p>
    <p>The designated supervisor shall periodically review the temporary information files to verify that the contents meet the criteria for retention. Validation and purging of files is the responsibility of the supervisor.</p>

    <h3>441.5 INFORMATION RECOGNITION</h3>
    <p>Department members should document facts that suggest an individual, organization or enterprise is involved in criminal activity and should forward that information appropriately. Examples include, but are not limited to:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Gang indicia associated with a person or residence.</li>
        <li>Information related to a drug-trafficking operation.</li>
        <li>Vandalism indicating an animus for a particular group.</li>
        <li>Information related to an illegal gambling operation.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Department supervisors who utilize an authorized criminal intelligence system should work with the Training Supervisor to train members to identify information that may be particularly relevant for inclusion.</p>

    <h3>441.6 RELEASE OF INFORMATION</h3>
    <p>Department members shall comply with the rules of an authorized criminal intelligence system regarding inquiries and release of information.</p>
    <p>Information from a temporary information file may only be furnished to department members and other law enforcement agencies on a need-to-know basis and consistent with the Records Maintenance and Release Policy.</p>
    <p>When an inquiry is made by the parent or guardian of a juvenile as to whether that juvenile’s name is in a temporary information file, such information should be provided by the supervisor responsible for the temporary information file, unless there
        is good cause to believe that the release of such information might jeopardize an ongoing criminal investigation.</p>

    <h3>441.7 CRIMINAL STREET GANGS</h3>

    <h2>446 - Mobile Video Recorders</h2>
    <h3>446.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>The Metro Transit Police Department has equipped most marked patrol cars with Mobile Video Recording (MVR) systems to provide records of events and assist officers in the performance of their duties. This policy provides guidance on the use of these
        systems.</p>
    <h4>446.1.1 DEFINITIONS</h4>
    <p>Definitions related to this policy include:</p>
    <p><strong>Activate</strong> - Any process that causes the MVR system to transmit or store video or audio data in an active mode.</p>
    <p><strong>In-car camera system and Mobile Video Recorder (MVR)</strong> - Synonymous terms - that refer to any system that captures audio and video signals that is capable of installation in a vehicle and that includes at minimum, a camera, microphone,
        recorder and monitor.</p>
    <p><strong>Law Enforcement Operator (LEO)</strong> - Primarily a licensed peace officer but on occasion may be a non-licensed representative of the Department who is authorized and assigned to operate MVR- equipped vehicles to the extent consistent with
        Minn. Stat. § 169.98.</p>
    <p><strong>MGDPA</strong> - The Minnesota Government Data Practices Act, Minnesota Statutes Chapter 13.</p>
    <p><strong>MVR technician</strong> - Personnel certified or trained in the operational use and repair of MVRs, duplicating methods, storage and retrieval methods and procedures, and who possess a working knowledge of video forensics and evidentiary procedures.</p>
    <p><strong>Recorded media</strong> - Audio-video signals recorded or digitally stored on a storage device or portable media.</p>

    <h3>446.2 POLICY</h3>
    <p>It is the goal of the Metro Transit Police Department to use mobile video recorder (MVR) technology to more effectively fulfill the department's mission and to ensure these systems are used securely and efficiently.</p>

    <h3>446.3 OFFICER RESPONSIBILITIES</h3>
    <p>Prior to going into service, each officer working patrol will properly equip him/herself to record audio and video in the field. It may be impractical for some officers to utilize audio/video in the field depending on their assignment (e.g. light
        rail, beat officers, special details/assignments etc). At the end of the shift, each officer will follow the established procedures for providing to the Department any recordings or used media and any other related equipment. Each officer should
        have adequate recording media for the entire duty assignment. Only Metro Transit Police Department identified and labeled media with tracking numbers is to be used.</p>
    <p>At the start of each shift, officers should test the MVR system operation in accordance with manufacturer specifications and department operating procedures and training.</p>
    <p>System documentation is accomplished by the officer recording his/her name, vehicle ID, area, shift etc. at the start and again at the end of each shift. If the system is malfunctioning, the officer shall take the vehicle out of service unless a supervisor
        requests the vehicle remain in service.</p>

    <h3>446.4 ACTIVATION OF THE MVR</h3>
    <p>The MVR system is designed to turn on in the following circumstances:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>The vehicles emergency lights are activated</li>
        <li>The vehicles brakes are locked up</li>
        <li>The vehicle reaches speeds of 80 mph</li>
        <li>The vehicle is involved in a collision</li>
        <li>Manually activated from the control panel or remotely from the officer's wireless transmitter</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The system remains on until it is turned off manually. The audio portion is independently controlled and should be activated manually by the officer whenever appropriate. When audio is being recorded, the video will also record.</p>
    <p>Operators are encouraged to narrate events using the audio recording so as to provide the best documentation for pretrial and courtroom presentation.</p>
    <h4>446.4.1 REQUIRED ACTIVATION OF THE MVR</h4>
    <p>This policy is not intended to describe every possible situation in which the MVR system may be used, although there are many situations where its use is appropriate. An officer may activate the system any time the officer believes its use would be
        appropriate and/or valuable to document an incident.</p>
    <p>In some circumstances it is not possible to capture images of the incident due to conditions or the location of the camera. However, the audio portion can be valuable evidence and is subject to the same activation requirements as the MVR. The MVR
        system should be activated in any of the following situations:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>All field contacts involving actual or potential criminal conduct within video or audio range:
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>Traffic stops (to include, but not limited to, traffic violations, stranded motorist assistance and all crime interdiction stops)</li>
                <li>Priority responses</li>
                <li>Vehicle pursuits</li>
                <li>Suspicious vehicles</li>
                <li>Arrests</li>
                <li>Field Identification / Field Elimination Show-Up</li>
                <li>Physical or verbal confrontations or use of force</li>
                <li>Prisoner transports</li>
                <li>Non-custody transports</li>
                <li>Pedestrian checks</li>
                <li>DWI investigations including field sobriety tests</li>
                <li>Consensual encounters</li>
                <li>Crimes in progress</li>
                <li>Responding to an in-progress call</li>
                <li>Medical incidents attended to by members of the Department</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>All self-initiated activity in which an officer would normally notify Transit Control Center</li>
        <li>Any call for service involving a crime where the recorder may aid in the apprehension and/ or prosecution of a suspect:
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>Family violence calls</li>
                <li>Disturbance of peace calls</li>
                <li>Offenses involving violence or weapons</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Any other contact that becomes adversarial after the initial contact, in a situation that would not otherwise require recording</li>
        <li>Any other circumstance where the officer believes that a recording of an incident would be appropriate</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>446.4.2 CESSATION OF RECORDING</h4>
    <p>Once activated, the MVR system should remain on until the incident has concluded. For purposes of this section, conclusion of an incident has occurred when all arrests have been made, arrestees have been transported and all witnesses and victims have
        been interviewed. Recording may cease if an officer is simply waiting for a tow truck or a family member to arrive, or in other similar situations.</p>
    <h4>446.4.3 WHEN ACTIVATION IS NOT REQUIRED</h4>
    <p>Activation of the MVR system is not required when exchanging information with other officers or during breaks, lunch periods, when not in service or actively on patrol.</p>
    <p>No member of this department may surreptitiously use Metropolitan Council / Metro Transit equipment to record a conversation of any other member of this department except with a court order or when lawfully authorized by the Chief of Police or the
        authorized designee for the purpose of conducting a criminal or administrative investigation.</p>
    <h4>446.4.4 SUPERVISOR RESPONSIBILITIES</h4>
    <p>Supervisors should determine if vehicles with non-functioning MVR systems should be placed into service. If these vehicles are placed into service, the appropriate documentation should be made, including notification of the Transit Control Center.</p>
    <p>At reasonable intervals, supervisors should validate that:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Beginning and end-of-shift recording procedures are followed (log-in and log-out).</li>
        <li>Logs reflect the proper chain of custody, including (if applicable):
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>The tracking number of the MVR system media.</li>
                <li>The date it was issued.</li>
                <li>The law enforcement operator or the vehicle to which it was issued.</li>
                <li>The date it was submitted.</li>
                <li>Law enforcement operators submitting the media.</li>
                <li>Holds for evidence indication and tagging as required.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>The operation of MVR systems by new employees is assessed and reviewed no less than biweekly.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>When an incident arises that requires the immediate retrieval of the recorded media (e.g., serious crime scenes, peace officer-involved shootings, department-involved collisions), a supervisor shall respond to the scene and ensure that the appropriate
        supervisor, MVR technician or crime scene investigator properly retrieves the recorded media. The media may need to be treated as evidence and should be handled in accordance with current evidence procedures for recorded media. Copies may be distributed
        to investigators as appropriate to the investigation.</p>
    <p>Supervisors may activate the MVR system remotely to monitor a developing situation such as a chase, riot or an event that may threaten public safety, officer safety or both, when the purpose is to obtain tactical information to assist in managing
        the event.</p>

    <h3>446.5 REVIEW OF MVR RECORDINGS</a></h3>
    <p>All recording media, recorded images and audio recordings are the property of the agency and subject to the provisions of the MGDPA. Dissemination outside of the agency is strictly prohibited except to the extent permitted or required under the MGDPA,
        Peace Officer Disciplinary Procedures Act or other applicable law.</p>
    <p>To prevent damage to, or alteration of, the original recorded media, it shall not be copied, viewed or otherwise inserted into any device not approved by the department MVR technician, forensic media staff or other authorized personnel. When reasonably
        possible, a copy of the original media shall be used for viewing (unless otherwise directed by the courts) to preserve the original media.</p>
    <p>Recordings may be reviewed in any of the following situations.</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>For use when preparing reports or statements</li>
        <li>By a supervisor investigating a specific act of officer conduct</li>
        <li>By a supervisor to assess officer performance</li>
        <li>To assess proper functioning of MVR systems</li>
        <li>By department investigators, after approval of a supervisor, who are participating in an official investigation such as a personnel complaint, administrative inquiry or a criminal investigation</li>
        <li>By department personnel who request to review recordings</li>
        <li>By an officer who is captured on or referenced in the video or audio data and reviews and uses the data for any purpose relating to his/her employment</li>
        <li>By court personnel through proper process or with permission of the Chief of Police or the authorized designee</li>
        <li>By the media through proper process or with an MGDPA request (Minn. Stat. § 13.01 et seq.)</li>
        <li>To assess possible training value</li>
        <li>Recordings may be shown for staff or public safety training purposes. If an involved officer objects to showing a recording, his/her objection will be submitted to the staff to determine if the training value outweighs the officer's objection</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Employees desiring to view any previously uploaded or archived MVR recording should submit a request in writing to the Shift Supervisor. Approved requests should be forwarded to the MVR technician for processing.</p>
    <p>In no event shall any recording be used or shown for the purpose of ridiculing or embarrassing any employee.</p>

    <h3>446.6 DOCUMENTING MVR USE</h3>
    <p>If any incident is recorded with either the video or audio system, the existence of that recording shall be documented in the officer's report. If a citation is issued, the officer shall make a notation on the records copy of the citation indicating
        that the incident was recorded.</p>

    <h3>446.7 RECORDING MEDIA STORAGE AND INTEGRITY</h3>
    <p>Once submitted for storage, all recording media will be labeled and stored in a designated secure area. All recording media that is not booked in as evidence will be retained for a minimum of 30 days and disposed of in compliance with the established
        records retention schedule.</p>
    <h4>446.7.1 COPIES OF ORIGINAL RECORDING MEDIA</h4>
    <p>Original recording media shall not be used for any purpose other than for initial review by a supervisor. Upon proper request, a copy of the original recording media will be made for use as authorized in this policy.</p>
    <p>Original recording media may only be released in response to a court order or upon approval by the Chief of Police or the authorized designee. In the event an original recording is released to a court, a copy shall be made and placed in storage until
        the original is returned.</p>
    <h4>446.7.2 MVR RECORDINGS AS EVIDENCE</h4>
    <p>Officers who reasonably believe that an MVR recording is likely to contain evidence relevant to a criminal offense, potential claim against the officer or against the Metro Transit Police Department, should indicate this in an appropriate report.
        Officers should ensure relevant recordings are preserved by saving and tagging the incident appropriately.</p>

    <h2>448 - Mobile Digital Computer Use</h2>
    <h3>448.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this policy is to establish guidelines for the proper access, use and application of the Mobile Digital Computer (MDC) system in order to ensure appropriate access to confidential records from local, state and national law enforcement
        databases, and to ensure effective electronic communications between department members and Transit Control Center.</p>

    <h3>448.2 POLICY</h3>
    <p>Metro Transit Police Department members using the MDC shall comply with all appropriate federal and state rules and regulations and shall use the MDC in a professional manner, in accordance with this policy.</p>

    <h3>448.3 PRIVACY EXPECTATION</h3>
    <p>Members forfeit any expectation of privacy with regard to messages accessed, transmitted, received or reviewed on any department technology system (see the Information Technology Use Policy for additional guidance).</p>

    <h3>448.4 RESTRICTED ACCESS AND USE</h3>
    <p>MDC use is subject to the Information Technology Use and Protected Information policies.</p>
    <p>Members shall not access the MDC system if they have not received prior authorization and the required training. Members shall immediately report unauthorized access or use of the MDC by another member to their supervisors or Shift Supervisors.</p>
    <p>Use of the MDC system to access law enforcement databases or transmit messages is restricted to official activities, business-related tasks and communications that are directly related to the business, administration or practices of the Department.
        In the event that a member has questions about sending a particular message or accessing a particular database, the member should seek prior approval from his/her supervisor.</p>
    <p>Sending derogatory, defamatory, obscene, disrespectful, sexually suggestive, harassing or any other inappropriate messages on the MDC system is prohibited and may result in discipline.</p>
    <p>It is a violation of this policy to transmit a message or access a law enforcement database under another member’s name or to use the password of another member to log in to the MDC system unless directed to do so by a supervisor. Members are required
        to log off the MDC or secure the MDC when it is unattended. This added security measure will minimize the potential for unauthorized access or misuse.</p>
    <h4>448.4.1 USE WHILE DRIVING</h4>
    <p>Use of the MDC by the vehicle operator should generally be limited to times when the vehicle is stopped. When the vehicle is in motion, the operator should only attempt to read messages that are likely to contain information that is required for immediate
        enforcement, investigative or safety needs.</p>
    <p>Short transmissions, such as a license plate check, are permitted if it reasonably appears that it can be done safely. In no case shall an operator attempt to send or review lengthy messages while the vehicle is in motion.</p>

    <h3>448.5 EQUIPMENT CONSIDERATIONS</h3>
    <h4>448.5.1 BOMB CALLS</h4>
    <p>When investigating reports of possible bombs, members should not communicate on their MDCs when in the evacuation area of a suspected explosive device. Radio frequency emitted by the MDC could cause some devices to detonate.</p>
    <h4>448.5.2 MALFUNCTIONING MDC</h4>
    <p>Whenever possible, members will not use vehicles with malfunctioning MDCs. Whenever members must drive a vehicle in which the MDC is not working, they shall notify Transit Control Center. It shall be the responsibility of the dispatcher to document
        all information that will then be transmitted verbally over the police radio.</p>

    <h3>448.6 DOCUMENTATION OF ACTIVITY</h3>
    <p>Except as otherwise directed by the Shift Supervisor or other department-established protocol, all calls for service assigned by a dispatcher should be communicated by voice over the police radio and electronically via the MDC unless security or confidentiality
        prevents such broadcasting.</p>
    <p>MDC and voice transmissions are used to document the member's daily activity. To ensure accuracy:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>All contacts or activity shall be documented at the time of the contact.</li>
        <li>Whenever the activity or contact is initiated by voice, it should be documented by a dispatcher.</li>
        <li>Whenever the activity or contact is not initiated by voice, the member shall document it via the MDC.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>448.6.1 STATUS CHANGES</h4>
    <p>All changes in status (e.g., arrival at scene, meal periods, in service) will be transmitted over the police radio or through the MDC system.</p>
    <p>Members responding to in-progress calls should advise changes in status over the radio to assist other members responding to the same incident. Other changes in status can be made on the MDC.</p>
    <h4>448.6.2 EMERGENCY ACTIVATION</h4>
    <p>If there is an emergency activation and the member does not respond to a request for confirmation of the need for emergency assistance or confirms the need, available resources will be sent to assist in locating the member. If the location is known,
        the nearest available officer should respond in accordance with the Officer Response to Calls Policy.</p>
    <p>Members should ensure a field supervisor and the Shift Supervisor is notified of the incident without delay.</p>
    <p>Officers not responding to the emergency shall refrain from transmitting on the police radio until a no-further-assistance broadcast is made or if they are also handling an emergency.</p>

    <h2>450 - Portable Audio/Video Recorders</h2>
    <h3>450.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>This policy provides guidelines for the use of portable audio/video recording devices by members of this department while in the performance of their duties. Portable audio/video recording devices include all recording systems whether body-worn, hand
        held or integrated into portable equipment.</p>
    <p>This policy does not apply to lawful surreptitious audio/video recording, interception of communications for authorized investigative purposes or to mobile audio/video recordings (see the Investigation and Prosecution and Mobile Video Recorders policies).</p>

    <h3>450.2 POLICY</h3>
    <p>The Metro Transit Police Department may provide members with access to portable recorders, either audio or video or both, for use during the performance of their duties. The use of recorders is intended to enhance the mission of the Department by
        accurately capturing contacts between members of the Department and the public.</p>

    <h3>450.3 MEMBER PRIVACY EXPECTATION</h3>
    <p>All recordings made by members acting in an official capacity shall remain the property of the Department regardless of whether those recordings were made with department-issued or personally owned recorders. Members shall have no expectation of privacy
        or ownership interest in the content of these recordings.</p>

    <h3>450.4 MEMBER RESPONSIBILITIES</h3>
    <p>If/when portable audio/video recording devices are implemented, prior to going into service, each uniformed member will be responsible for making sure that he/she is equipped with a portable recorder issued by the Department, and that the recorder
        is in good working order. If the recorder is not in working order or malfunctions at any time, the member shall promptly report the failure to his/her supervisor and obtain a functioning device as soon as practicable. Uniformed members should
        wear the recorder in a conspicuous manner or otherwise notify persons that they are being recorded, whenever possible.</p>
    <p>Any member assigned to a non-uniformed position may carry an approved portable recorder at any time the member believes that such a device may be useful. Unless conducting a lawful recording in an authorized undercover capacity, non-uniformed members
        should wear the recorder in a conspicuous manner when in use or otherwise notify persons that they are being recorded, whenever possible.</p>
    <p>When using a portable recorder, the assigned member shall record his/her name, employee number and the current date and time at the beginning and the end of the shift or other period of use, regardless of whether any activity was recorded. This procedure
        is not required when the recording device and related software captures the user’s unique identification and the date and time of each recording.</p>
    <p>Members should document the existence of a recording in any report or other official record of the contact, including any instance where the recorder malfunctioned or the member deactivated the recording. Members should include the reason for deactivation.</p>

    <h3>450.5 ACTIVATION OF THE PORTABLE RECORDER</h3>
    <p>This policy is not intended to describe every possible situation in which the portable recorder should be used, although there are many situations where its use is appropriate. Members should activate the recorder any time the member believes it would
        be appropriate or valuable to record an incident.</p>
    <p>The portable recorder should be activated in any of the following situations:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>All enforcement and investigative contacts including stops and field interview (FI) situations</li>
        <li>Traffic stops including, but not limited to, traffic violations, stranded motorist assistance and all crime interdiction stops</li>
        <li>Self-initiated activity in which a member would normally notify Transit Control Center</li>
        <li>Any other contact that becomes adversarial after the initial contact in a situation that would not otherwise require recording</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Members should remain sensitive to the dignity of all individuals being recorded and exercise sound discretion to respect privacy by discontinuing recording whenever it reasonably appears to the member that such privacy may outweigh any legitimate
        law enforcement interest in recording. Requests by members of the public to stop recording should be considered using this same criterion. Recording should resume when privacy is no longer at issue unless the circumstances no longer fit the criteria
        for recording.</p>
    <p>At no time is a member expected to jeopardize his/her safety in order to activate a portable recorder or change the recording media. However, the recorder should be activated in situations described above as soon as practicable.</p>
    <h4>450.5.1 CESSATION OF RECORDING</h4>
    <p>Once activated, the portable recorder should remain on continuously until the member’s direct participation in the incident is complete or the situation no longer fits the criteria for activation. Recording may be stopped during significant periods
        of inactivity such as report writing or other breaks from direct participation in the incident.</p>
    <h4>450.5.2 SURREPTITIOUS USE OF THE PORTABLE RECORDER</h4>
    <p>Minnesota law permits an individual to surreptitiously record any conversation in which one party to the conversation has given his/her permission (Minn. Stat. § 626A.02).</p>
    <p>Members of the Department may surreptitiously record any conversation during the course of a criminal investigation in which the member reasonably believes that such a recording will be lawful and beneficial to the investigation.</p>
    <p>Members shall not surreptitiously record another department member without a court order unless lawfully authorized by the Chief of Police or the authorized designee.</p>
    <h4>450.5.3 EXPLOSIVE DEVICE</h3>
	<p>Many portable recorders, including body-worn cameras and audio/video transmitters, emit radio waves that could trigger an explosive device. Therefore, these devices should not be used where an explosive device may be present.</p>

    <h3>450.6 PROHIBITED USE OF PORTABLE RECORDERS</h3>
    <p>Members are prohibited from using department-issued portable recorders and recording media for personal use and are prohibited from making personal copies of recordings created while on- duty or while acting in their official capacity.</p>
    <p>Members are also prohibited from retaining recordings of activities or information obtained while on-duty, whether the recording was created with department-issued or personally owned recorders. Members shall not duplicate or distribute such recordings, except for authorized legitimate department business purposes. All such recordings shall be retained at the Department.</p>
    <p>Members are prohibited from using personally owned recording devices while on-duty without the express consent of the Shift Supervisor. Any member who uses a personally owned recorder for department-related activities shall comply with the provisions of this policy, including retention and release requirements.</p>
    <p>Recordings shall not be used by any member for the purpose of embarrassment, intimidation or ridicule.</p>

    <h3>450.7 RETENTION OF RECORDINGS</h3>
    <p>Any time a member records any portion of a contact that the member reasonably believes constitutes evidence in a criminal case, the member shall record the related case number and transfer the file in accordance with current procedure for storing digital files and document the existence of the recording in the related case report. Transfers should occur at the end of the member’s shift, or any time the storage capacity is nearing its limit.</p>
    <p>Any time a member reasonably believes a recorded contact may be beneficial in a non-criminal matter (e.g., a hostile contact), the member should promptly notify a supervisor of the existence of the recording.</p>
    <h4>450.7.1 RETENTION REQUIREMENTS</h4>
    <p>Portable recordings may be considered criminal investigative data subject to public disclosure (Minn. Stat. § 13.82, Subd. 7). All recordings shall be retained for a period consistent with the requirements of the organization’s records retention schedule
        but in no event for a period less than 30 days.</p>

    <h3>450.8 REVIEW OF RECORDINGS</h3>
    <p>When preparing written reports, members should review their recordings as a resource. However, members shall not retain personal copies of recordings. Members should not use the fact that a recording was made as a reason to write a less detailed report.</p>
    <p>Supervisors are authorized to review relevant recordings any time they are investigating alleged misconduct or reports of meritorious conduct or whenever such recordings would be beneficial in reviewing the member’s performance.</p>
    <p>Recorded files may also be reviewed:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Upon approval by a supervisor, by any member of the Department who is participating in an official investigation, such as a personnel complaint, administrative investigation or criminal investigation.</li>
        <li>Pursuant to lawful process or by court personnel who are otherwise authorized to review evidence in a related case.</li>
        <li>By media personnel with permission of the Chief of Police or the authorized designee.</li>
        <li>In compliance with the Minnesota Data Practices Act request, if permitted or required by the Act, and in accordance with the Records Maintenance and Release Policy.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>All recordings should be reviewed by the Custodian of Records prior to public release (see the Records Maintenance and Release Policy). Recordings that unreasonably violate a person’s privacy or sense of dignity should not be publicly released unless
        disclosure is required by law or order of the court.</p>

    <h2>454 - Bicycle Patrol Unit</h2>
    <h3>454.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>The Metro Transit Police Department has established an auxiliary Bicycle Patrol Unit (BPU) for the purpose of enhancing patrol efforts in the community. Bicycle patrol has been shown to be an effective way to increase officer visibility in congested
        areas. A bicycle's quiet operation can provide a tactical approach to crimes in progress. The purpose of this policy is to provide guidelines for the safe and effective operation of the patrol bicycle.</p>

    <h3>454.2 POLICY</h3>
    <p>Patrol bicycles may be used for regular patrol duty, traffic enforcement, parking control or special events. The use of the patrol bicycle will emphasize its mobility and visibility to the community.</p>
    <p>Bicycles may be deployed to any area at all hours of the day or night, according to Department needs and as staffing levels allow.</p>
    <p>Requests for specific deployment of bicycle patrol officers shall be coordinated through the BPU supervisor or the Shift Supervisor.</p>

    <h3>454.3 SELECTION OF PERSONNEL</h3>
    <p>Licensed personnel, who are off probation, may submit a letter of interest upon a vacancy being posted. Although typically reserved for officers assigned to either the Minneapolis or St. Paul Beats, interested officers are encouraged to apply. Interested
        personnel shall be evaluated by the following criteria:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Desire to be a member of the Bicycle Patrol Unit (e.g. submitting a letter of interest).</li>
        <li>Recognized competence and ability as evidenced by performance.</li>
        <li>Special skills or training as it pertains to the assignment.</li>
        <li>Good physical condition.</li>
        <li>Willingness to perform duties using the bicycle as a mode of transportation.</li>
        <li>Other criteria may be established at the time of the Bicycle Patrol Unit posting.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>454.3.1 BICYCLE PATROL UNIT SUPERVISOR</h4>
    <p>The BPU supervisor will be selected by the Patrol Captain or designee. The BPU supervisor shall have responsibility for the following:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Organizing bicycle patrol training.</li>
        <li>Inspecting and maintaining inventory of patrol bicycles and program equipment.</li>
        <li>Scheduling maintenance and repairs.</li>
        <li>Coordinating activities with the Patrol Division.</li>
        <li>Inspection and documentation that bicycles not in active service are in a serviceable condition.</li>
        <li>Other activities as required to maintain the efficient operation of the unit.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>454.4 TRAINING</h3>
    <p>Participants in the program must complete a Department-approved bicycle-training course after acceptance into the program. Thereafter, bicycle patrol officers should receive yearly in-service training to improve skills and refresh safety, health and
        operational procedures. The initial training shall minimally include the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Bicycle patrol strategies</li>
        <li>Bicycle safety and accident prevention</li>
        <li>Operational tactics using bicycles</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Bicycle patrol officers may be required to qualify with their duty firearm while wearing bicycle safety equipment, including the helmet and riding gloves.</p>

    <h3>454.5 UNIFORMS AND EQUIPMENT</h3>
    <p>Officers shall wear the department-approved uniform and safety equipment while operating the department bicycle. Safety equipment includes department-approved helmet, riding gloves, protective eye wear and approved footwear.</p>
    <p>The bicycle patrol uniform consists of the standard short-sleeve uniform shirt or other department- approved shirt with department badge and patches, and department-approved bicycle patrol pants or shorts. The Uniform and Equipment Specifications
        Manual shall be consulted for specific uniform requirements.</p>
    <p>Bicycle patrol officers shall carry the same equipment on the bicycle patrol duty belt as they would on a regular patrol assignment.</p>
    <p>Officers will be responsible for obtaining the necessary forms, citation books and other department equipment needed while on bicycle patrol.</p>

    <h3>454.6 CARE AND USE OF PATROL BICYCLES</h3>
    <p>Officers will be assigned a specially marked and equipped patrol bicycle, attached gear bag and accessories.</p>
    <p>Bicycles utilized for uniformed bicycle patrol shall be primarily black or white with a "Police" decal affixed to each side of the crossbar or the bike's saddlebag. Every such bicycle shall be equipped with either lamps and/or reflectors and must
        meet legal requirements.</p>
    <p>Bicycles utilized for uniformed bicycle patrol shall be equipped with a rear rack and/or saddle bag(s) sufficient to carry the necessary equipment for handling routine patrol calls, including report writing and citations.</p>
    <p>Each bicycle gear bag shall include a repair tool and tire tube. Recommended, but optional equipment, include security locks, tire pump and a first aid kit. These items shall remain with/on the bicycle at all times.</p>
    <p>Bicycle officers shall conduct an inspection of the bicycle and equipment prior to use to ensure proper working order of the equipment. Officers are responsible for the routine care and maintenance of their assigned equipment (e.g., tire pressure,
        chain lubrication and overall cleaning).</p>
    <p>If a needed repair is beyond the ability of the bicycle officer, the program supervisor shall be notified and they shall arrange for repair by an approved technician.</p>
    <p>Each bicycle will have scheduled maintenance performed annually by a Department-approved repair shop/technician.</p>
    <p>At the end of a bicycle assignment, the bicycle shall be returned clean and ready for the next tour of duty.</p>
    <p>Officers shall not modify the patrol bicycle, remove, modify or add components except with the express approval of the bicycle supervisor or in the event of an emergency.</p>
    <p>Vehicle bicycle racks are available should the officer need to transport the patrol bicycle. Due to possible component damage, transportation of the patrol bicycle in a trunk or on a patrol car push- bumper is discouraged.</p>
    <p>Bicycles shall be properly secured when not in the officer's immediate presence.</p>

    <h3>454.7 OFFICER RESPONSIBILITIES</h3>
    <p>Officers are exempt from operating the bicycle in compliance with Minnesota law while performing their duties (Minn. Stat. § 169.222 Subd. 11). Officers may operate the bicycle without lighting equipment during hours of darkness, when such operation
        reasonably appears necessary for officer safety and tactical considerations. Officers must use caution and care when operating the bicycle without lighting equipment.</p>

            <div class="chapter" id="458">
    <h2>458 - Foot Pursuits</h2>
    <h3>458.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>This policy provides guidelines to assist officers in making the decision to initiate or continue the pursuit of suspects on foot.</p>

    <h3>458.2 POLICY</h3>
    <p>It is the policy of this department that officers, when deciding to initiate or continue a foot pursuit, must continuously balance the objective of apprehending the suspect with the risk and potential for injury to department members, the public or
        the suspect.</p>
    <p>Officers are expected to act reasonably based on the totality of the circumstances.</p>

    <h3>458.3 DECISION TO PURSUE</h3>
    <p>The safety of department members and the public should be the primary consideration when determining whether a foot pursuit should be initiated or continued. Officers must be mindful that immediate apprehension of a suspect is rarely more important
        than the safety of the public and department members.</p>
    <p>Officers may be justified in initiating a foot pursuit of any individual the officer reasonably believes is about to engage in, is engaging in or has engaged in criminal activity. The decision to initiate or continue such a foot pursuit, however,
        must be continuously re-evaluated in light of the circumstances presented at the time.</p>
    <p>Mere flight by a person who is not suspected of criminal activity shall not serve as the sole justification for engaging in an extended foot pursuit without the development of reasonable suspicion regarding the individual’s involvement in criminal
        activity or being wanted by law enforcement.</p>
    <p>Deciding to initiate or continue a foot pursuit is a decision that an officer must make quickly and under unpredictable and dynamic circumstances. It is recognized that foot pursuits potentially place department members and the public at significant
        risk. Therefore, no officer or supervisor shall be criticized or disciplined for deciding not to engage in a foot pursuit because of the perceived risk involved.</p>
    <p>If circumstances permit, surveillance and containment are generally the safest tactics for apprehending fleeing persons. In deciding whether to initiate or continue a foot pursuit, an officer should continuously consider reasonable alternatives to
        a foot pursuit based upon the circumstances and resources available, such as the following:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Containment of the area.</li>
        <li>Saturation of the area with law enforcement personnel, including assistance from other agencies.</li>
        <li>A canine search.</li>
        <li>Thermal imaging or other sensing technology.</li>
        <li>Air support.</li>
        <li>Apprehension at another time, when the identity of the suspect is known or there is information available that would likely allow for later apprehension, and the need to immediately apprehend the suspect does not reasonably appear to outweigh
            the risk of continuing the foot pursuit.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>458.4 GENERAL GUIDELINES</h3>
    <p>When reasonably practicable, officers should consider alternatives to engaging in or continuing a foot pursuit when:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Directed by a supervisor to terminate the foot pursuit; such an order shall be considered mandatory.</li>
        <li>The officer is acting alone.</li>
        <li>Two or more officers become separated, lose visual contact with one another or obstacles separate them to the degree that they cannot immediately assist each other should a confrontation take place. In such circumstances, it is generally recommended
            that a single officer keep the suspect in sight from a safe distance and coordinate the containment effort.</li>
        <li>The officer is unsure of his/her location and direction of travel.</li>
        <li>The officeris pursuing multiple suspects and it is not reasonable to believe that the officer would be able to control the suspect should a confrontation occur.</li>
        <li>The physical condition of the officers renders him/her incapable of controlling the suspect if apprehended.</li>
        <li>The officer loses radio contact with Transit Control Center or with assisting or backup officers.</li>
        <li>The suspect enters a building, structure, confined space, isolated area or dense or difficult terrain, and there are insufficient officers to provide backup and containment. The primary officer should consider discontinuing the foot pursuit and
            coordinating containment pending the arrival of sufficient resources.</li>
        <li>The officer becomes aware of unanticipated or unforeseen circumstances that unreasonably increase the risk to officers or the public.</li>
        <li>The officer reasonably believes that the danger to the pursuing officers or public outweighs the objective of immediate apprehension.</li>
        <li>The officer loses possession of his/her firearm or other essential equipment.</li>
        <li>The officer or a third party is injured during the foot pursuit, requiring immediate assistance, and there are no other emergency personnel available to render assistance.</li>
        <li>The suspect’s location is no longer known.</li>
        <li>The identity of the suspect is established or other information exists that will allow for the suspect’s apprehension at a later time, and it reasonably appears that there is no immediate threat to Department personnel or the public if the suspect
            is not immediately apprehended.</li>
        <li>The officer’s ability to safely continue the pursuit is impaired by inclement weather, darkness or other environmental conditions.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>458.5 RESPONSIBILITIES IN FOOT PURSUITS</h3>
    <h4>458.5.1 INITIATING OFFICER RESPONSIBILITIES</h3>
									                        <p>Unless relieved by another officer or a supervisor, the initiating officer shall be responsible for coordinating the progress of the pursuit. When acting alone and when practicable, the initiating officer should not attempt to overtake and confront the suspect but should attempt to keep the suspect in sight until sufficient officers are present to safely apprehend the suspect.</p>
									                        <p>Early communication of available information from the involved officers is essential so that adequate resources can be coordinated and deployed to bring a foot pursuit to a safe conclusion. Officers initiating a foot pursuit should broadcast the following information as soon as it becomes practicable and available:</p>
									                        <ol class="alpha">
									                            <li>Location and direction of travel</li>
									                            <li>Call sign identifier</li>
									                            <li>Reason for the foot pursuit, such as the crime classification</li>
									                            <li>Number of suspects and description, to include name if known</li>
									                            <li>Whether the suspect is known or believed to be armed with a dangerous weapon</li>
									                        </ol>
									                        <p>Officers should be mindful that radio transmissions made while running may be difficult to understand and may need to be repeated.</p>
									                        <p>Absent extenuating circumstances, any officer unable to promptly and effectively broadcast this information should terminate the foot pursuit. If the foot pursuit is discontinued for any reason, immediate efforts for containment should be established and alternatives considered based upon the circumstances and available resources.</p>
									                        <p>When a foot pursuit terminates, the officer will notify Transit Control Center of his/her location and the status of the foot pursuit termination (e.g., suspect in custody, lost sight of suspect), and will direct further actions as reasonably appear necessary, to include requesting medical aid as needed for officers, suspects or members of the public.</p>
									                        <h4>458.5.2 ASSISTING OFFICER RESPONSIBILITIES</h4>
    <p>Whenever any officer announces that he/she is engaged in a foot pursuit, all other officers should minimize nonessential radio traffic to permit the involved officers maximum access to the radio frequency.</p>
    <h4>458.5.3 SUPERVISOR RESPONSIBILITIES</h4>
    <p>Upon becoming aware of a foot pursuit, the supervisor shall make every reasonable effort to ascertain sufficient information to direct responding resources and to take command, control and coordination of the foot pursuit. The supervisor should respond
        to the area whenever reasonably possible. The supervisor does not, however, need to be physically present to exercise control over the foot pursuit. The supervisor should continuously assess the situation in order to ensure the foot pursuit is
        conducted within established department guidelines.</p>
    <p>The supervisor shall terminate the foot pursuit when the danger to pursuing officers or the public appears to unreasonably outweigh the objective of immediate apprehension of the suspect.</p>
    <p>Upon apprehension of the suspect, the supervisor should promptly proceed to the termination point to direct the post-pursuit activity.</p>
    <h4>458.5.4 TRANSIT CONTROL CENTER RESPONSIBILITIES</h4>
    <p>Upon notification or becoming aware that a foot pursuit is in progress, the dispatcher is responsible for:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Clearing the radio channel of non-emergency traffic.</li>
        <li>Coordinating pursuit communications of the involved officers.</li>
        <li>Broadcasting pursuit updates as well as other pertinent information as necessary.</li>
        <li>Ensuring that a field supervisor is notified of the foot pursuit.</li>
        <li>Notifying and coordinating with other involved or affected agencies as practicable.</li>
        <li>Notifying the Shift Supervisor as soon as practicable.</li>
        <li>Assigning an incident number and logging all pursuit activities.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>458.6 REPORTING</h3>
    <p>The initiating officer shall complete the appropriate crime/arrest reports documenting, at minimum:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Date and time of the foot pursuit.</li>
        <li>Initial reason and circumstances surrounding the foot pursuit.</li>
        <li>Course and approximate distance of the foot pursuit.</li>
        <li>Alleged offenses.</li>
        <li>Involved vehicles and officers.</li>
        <li>Whether a suspect was apprehended as well as the means and methods used.</p>
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>Any use of force shall be reported and documented in compliance with the Use of Force Policy.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Arrestee information, if applicable.</li>
        <li>Any injuries and/or medical treatment.</li>
        <li>Any property or equipment damage.</li>
        <li>Name of the supervisor at the scene or who handled the incident.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Assisting officers taking an active role in the apprehension of the suspect shall complete supplemental reports as necessary or as directed.</p>
    <p>The supervisor reviewing the report will make a preliminary determination that the pursuit appears to be in compliance with this policy or that additional review and/or follow-up is warranted.</p>
    <p>In any case in which a suspect is not apprehended and there is insufficient information to warrant further investigation, a supervisor may authorize that the initiating officer need not complete a formal report.</p>

    <h2>460 - Automated License Plate Readers (ALPR)</h2>
    <h3>460.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this policy is to provide guidance for the capture, storage and use of digital data obtained through the use of Automated License Plate Reader (ALPR) technology (Minn. Stat. § 626.8472).</p>

    <h3>460.2 ADMINISTRATION</h3>
    <p>The ALPR technology, also known as License Plate Recognition (LPR), allows for the automated detection of license plates. It may be used by the Metro Transit Police Department to convert data associated with vehicle license plates for official law
        enforcement purposes, including identifying stolen or wanted vehicles, stolen license plates and missing persons. It may also be used to gather information related to active warrants, homeland security, electronic surveillance, suspect interdiction
        and stolen property recovery.</p>
    <p>All installation and maintenance of ALPR equipment, as well as ALPR data retention and access, shall be managed by the Administrative Division Supervisor. The Administrative Division Supervisor will assign members under his/her command to administer
        the day-to-day operation of the ALPR equipment and data.</p>

    <h3>460.3 OPERATIONS</h3>
    <p>Use of an ALPR is restricted to the purposes outlined below. Department members shall not use, or allow others to use, the equipment or database records for any unauthorized purpose.</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>An ALPR shall only be used for official law enforcement business.</li>
        <li>An ALPR may be used in conjunction with any routine patrol operation or criminal investigation. Reasonable suspicion or probable cause is not necessary before using an ALPR.</li>
        <li>While an ALPR may be used to canvass license plates around any crime scene, particular consideration should be given to using ALPR-equipped cars to canvass areas around homicides, shootings and other major incidents.</li>
        <li>No member of this department shall operate ALPR equipment or access ALPR data without first completing department-approved training.</li>
        <li>No ALPR operator may access confidential department, state or federal data unless authorized to do so.</li>
        <li>If practicable, the officer should verify an ALPR response through the Minnesota Justice Information Services (MNJIS) and National Law Enforcement Telecommunications System (NLETS) databases before taking enforcement action that is based solely
            upon an ALPR alert.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>460.3.1 RESTRICTIONS, NOTIFICATIONS AND AUDITS</h4>
    <p>The Metro Transit Police Department will observe the following guidelines regarding ALPR use (Minn. Stat. § 13.824):</p>
    <ol class="alpha">

        <li>ALPRs shall not be used to monitor or track an individual unless done so under a search warrant or because of exigent circumstances.</li>
        <li>The Bureau of Criminal Apprehension shall be notified within 10 days of any installation or use and of any fixed location of an ALPR.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>460.4 DATA COLLECTION AND RETENTION</h3>
    <p>The Administrative Division Supervisor is responsible for ensuring systems and processes are in place for the proper collection and retention of ALPR data. Data will be transferred from vehicles to the designated storage in accordance with department
        procedures.</p>
    <p>ALPR data received from another agency shall be maintained securely and released in the same manner as ALPR data collected by this department (Minn. Stat. § 13.824).</p>
    <p>ALPR data not related to an active criminal investigation must be destroyed no later than 60 days from the date of collection with the following exceptions (Minn. Stat. § 13.824):</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Exculpatory evidence - Data must be retained until a criminal matter is resolved if a written request is made from a person who is the subject of a criminal investigation asserting that ALPR data may be used as exculpatory evidence.</li>
        <li>Address Confidentiality Program - Data related to a participant of the Address Confidentiality Program must be destroyed upon the written request of the participant. ALPR data already collected at the time of the request shall be destroyed and
            future related ALPR data must be destroyed at the time of collection. Destruction can be deferred if it relates to an active criminal investigation.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>All other ALPR data should be retained in accordance with the established records retention schedule.</p>
    <h4>460.4.1 LOG OF USE</h4>
    <p>A public log of ALPR use will be maintained that includes (Minn. Stat. § 13.824):</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Specific times of day that the ALPR collected data.</li>
        <li>The aggregate number of vehicles or license plates on which data are collected for each period of active use and a list of all state and federal public databases with which the data were compared.</li>
        <li>For each period of active use, the number of vehicles or license plates related to:

            <div class="chapter" id="464">
    <h2>464 - Homeless Persons</h2>
    <h3>464.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this policy is to ensure that personnel understand the needs and rights of the homeless and to establish procedures to guide officers during all contacts with the homeless, whether consensual or for enforcement purposes. The Metro Transit
        Police Department recognizes that members of the homeless community are often in need of special protection and services. The Metro Transit Police Department will address these needs in balance with the overall missions of this department. Therefore,
        officers will consider the following policy when serving the homeless community.</p>

    <h3>464.2 HOMELESS COMMUNITY LIAISON</h3>
    <p>The Chief of Police will designate a member of this department to act as the Homeless Liaison Officer. The responsibilities of the Homeless Liaison Officer include the following:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Maintain and make available to all Department employees a list of assistance programs and other resources that are available to the homeless.</li>
        <li>Meet with social services and representatives of other organizations that render assistance to the homeless.</li>
        <li>Maintain a list of those areas within and near this jurisdiction that are used as frequent homeless encampments.</li>
        <li>Remain abreast of laws dealing with the removal and/or destruction of the personal property of the homeless. This will include the following:
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>Proper posting of notices of trespass and clean-up operations.</li>
                <li>Proper retention of property after clean up, to include procedures for owners to reclaim their property in accordance with the Property Procedures Policy and other established procedures.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Be present during any clean-up operation conducted by this department involving the removal of personal property of the homeless to ensure the rights of the homeless are not violated.</li>
        <li>Develop training to assist officers in understanding current legal and social issues relating to the homeless.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>464.3 FIELD CONTACTS</h3>
    <p>Officers are encouraged to contact the homeless for purposes of rendering aid, support and for community-oriented policing purposes. Nothing in this policy is meant to dissuade an officer from taking reasonable enforcement action when facts support
        a reasonable suspicion of criminal activity. However, when encountering a homeless person who has committed a non-violent misdemeanor and continued freedom is not likely to result in a continuation of the offense or a</p>
    <p>breach of the peace, officers are encouraged to consider long-term solutions to problems that may relate to the homeless, such as shelter referrals and counseling in lieu of physical arrest. Officers should provide homeless persons with resource and
        assistance information whenever it is reasonably apparent such services may be appropriate.</p>
    <h4>464.3.1 OTHER CONSIDERATIONS</h4>
    <p>Homeless members of the community will receive the same level and quality of service provided to other members of our community. The fact that a victim or witness is homeless can, however, require special considerations for a successful investigation
        and prosecution. Officers should consider the following when handling investigations involving homeless victims, witnesses or suspects:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Documenting alternate contact information. This may include obtaining addresses and telephone numbers of relatives and friends.</li>
        <li>Document places the homeless person may frequent.</li>
        <li>Provide homeless victims with victim/witness resources when appropriate.</li>
        <li>Obtain statements from all available witnesses in the event a homeless victim is unavailable for a court appearance.</li>
        <li>Consider whether the person may be a dependent adult or elder and if so proceed in accordance with the Adult Abuse Policy.</li>
        <li>Arrange for transportation for investigation-related matters, such as medical exams and court appearances.</li>
        <li>Consider whether a crime should be reported and submitted for prosecution even when a homeless victim indicates he/she does not desire prosecution.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>464.4 PERSONAL PROPERTY</h3>
    <p>The personal property of homeless persons must not be treated differently than the property of other members of the public. Officers should use reasonable care when handling, collecting and retaining the personal property of homeless persons and should
        not destroy or discard the personal property of a homeless person.</p>
    <p>When a homeless person is arrested or otherwise removed from a public place, officers should make reasonable accommodations to permit the person to lawfully secure his/her personal property. Otherwise, the arrestee’s personal property should be collected
        for safekeeping. If the arrestee has more personal property than can reasonably be collected and transported by the officer, a supervisor should be consulted. The property should be photographed and measures should be taken to remove or secure
        the property. It will be the supervisor’s responsibility to coordinate the removal and safekeeping of the property.</p>
    <p>Officers should not conduct or assist in clean-up operations of belongings that reasonably appear to be the property of homeless persons without the prior authorization of a supervisor or the Department Homeless Liaison Officer. When practicable,
        requests by the public for clean-up operations of a homeless encampment should be referred to the Homeless Liaison Officer.</p>
    <p>Officers who encounter unattended encampments, bedding or other personal property in public areas that reasonably appears to belong to a homeless person should not remove or destroy such property and should inform the Department Homeless Liaison Officer
        if such property appears to involve a trespass, blight to the community or is the subject of a complaint. It will be the responsibility of the Homeless Liaison Officer to address the matter in a timely fashion.</p>

    <h3>464.5 MENTAL ILLNESSES AND MENTAL IMPAIRMENTS</h3>
    <p>Some homeless persons may suffer from a mental illness or a mental impairment. Officers shall not detain a homeless person under a 72-hour emergency medical hold unless facts and circumstances warrant such a detention.</p>

    <h3>464.6 ECOLOGICAL ISSUES</h3>
    <p>Sometimes homeless encampments can affect the ecology and natural resources of the community and may involve criminal offenses beyond mere littering. Officers are encouraged to notify other appropriate agencies or departments when a significant impact
        to the environment has or is likely to occur. Significant impacts to the environment may warrant a crime report, investigation, supporting photographs and supervisor notification.</p>

    <h3>464.7 POLICY</h3>
    <p>It is the policy of the Metro Transit Police Department to provide law enforcement services to all members of the community while protecting the rights, dignity and private property of the homeless. Homelessness is not a crime and members of this
        department will not use homelessness solely as a basis for detention or law enforcement action.</p>
</div>
            <div class="chapter" id="465">
    <h2>465 - Passenger / Customer Eviction</h2>
    <h3>465.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>It is the goal of the Metropolitan Council / Metro Transit to provide the Metro Transit passenger a conveyance which is safe, clean and responsive to the passengers riding experience. It is the policy of the Metropolitan Council / Metro Transit to
        evict passengers from a conveyance when a Metro Transit Police officer or Metro Transit operator has reason to believe that the passenger presents an immediate threat to the peace and/or safety of other passengers and/or the operator.</p>
    <p>The purpose of this policy is to provide guidelines for evicting passengers/customers from Metropolitan Council / Metro Transit conveyances/property and to establish reporting requirements for such actions.</p>

    <h3>465.2 CONSIDERATIONS WHEN EVICTING OR REMOVING PASSENGERS/CUSTOMERS </h3>
    <p>When considering whether or not to evict/remove a passenger(s) or customer(s), Metro Transit Police officers shall consider the totality of the circumstances presented at the time. These circumstances may include one or more of the following:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>The safety of other passengers, the operator, the responding officer, other Metro Transit and/or Metro Transit Police personnel.</li>
        <li>The safety of other motorists and/or public.</li>
        <li>The preservation of Metropolitan Council / Metro Transit property.</li>
        <li>Whether reasonable belief exists that the passenger/customer violated any Minnesota State Statute, law, ordinance, Metropolitan Council / Metro Transit policy or rule.
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>The above includes but is not limited to the interference, interruption, disruption or obstruction by the passenger/customer.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>The time of day, location, weather conditions, age of passenger(s), number of passengers and the condition of the passenger(s) at the time of eviction/removal.</li>
        <li>Any other factor(s) which reasonably assist Metro Transit Police officers in concluding that the removal or eviction of the passenger(s) is warranted.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>465.3 DOCUMENTING AN EVICTION OR REMOVAL</h3>
    <p>All Metro Transit Police officers operating within the scope of this policy will document all incidents on the appropriate Metro Transit Police report form(s) and/or records management system. Officers may refer to the Report Preparation Policy if
        further information is needed.</p>
</div>
            <div class="chapter" id="467">
    <h2>467 - Fare Enforcement</h2>
    <h3>467.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>It is the policy of Metro Transit that reasonable, non-discriminatory fares shall be charged for all public transportation services operated by the agency. The fare structure will be a "Service Based Structure" with fare levels determined by the type
        of service provided. Passengers will pay specified rates accordingly, unless they qualify for a reduced fare.</p>
    <p>The purpose of this policy is to define the role of Metro Transit Police officers as it relates to fare inspection.</p>

    <h3>467.2 ENFORCEMENT</h3>
    <p>Enforcement of the "Proof of Payment" fare collection process will be accomplished by Metro Transit Police officers. The role of Metro Transit Police officers, conducting fare inspection duty, is to educate customers on the proof-of-payment system
        and to take enforcement action against fare violators. These steps are implemented in an attempt to gain compliance within the established system.</p>
    <p>Metro Transit Police officers will be the primary point of contact with passengers. As such, the highest standards of integrity, fairness, impartiality and professionalism are expected of them. In terms of public acceptance and enforcement of the
        proof-of-payment system, the fare inspections are essential to the success of the system. The philosophy for fare inspection will be high visibility, with pleasant, yet firm enforcement. This philosophy dictates that Metro Transit Police officers
        apply interpersonal relationship skills and law enforcement authority to gain acceptance of and compliance with the proof-of-payment system.</p>
    <h4>467.2.1 INSPECTIONS</h4>
    <p>Metro Transit Police officers will randomly inspect passengers both onboard the conveyance and off while located in a "Paid Fare Zone." Officers shall announce their intent to inspect fares by stating something similar to, "Fare inspection" or "Please
        display your ticket for fare inspection." Passengers without proof of payment will be asked if they understand the fare system or have some other reason for not having a valid proof of payment (e.g. a malfunction with the ticket vending machine
        (TVM)). Officers will request appropriate documentation from passengers using disability cards, reduced fare cards and/or stored value cards.</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>If the officer is satisfied that the passenger did not intentionally evade payment of fare, the officer will explain the fare system to the passenger, issue a verbal warning and may ask the passenger to exit the conveyance to pay the proper fare.
            The officer may also allow the passenger to ride to their destination and ensure that the fare is paid at that time.</li>
        <li>If the officer decides that fare payment was intentionally avoided, a citation should be issued to the passenger. The officer may ask that the passenger exit the conveyance or may allow the passenger to ride to their destination and ensure that
            the fare is paid at that time.
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>If the passenger is found to be in violation for a second time, in addition to issuing a citation, the passenger may be trespassed for 30 days.</li>
                <li>If the passenger is found to be in violation for a third time (or more), he/she may be booked for the continued offense and if applicable, a trespass violation.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>467.3 DOCUMENTING FARE ENFORCEMENT</h3>
    <p>All Metro Transit Police officers operating within the scope of this policy will document all incidents on the appropriate Metro Transit Police report form(s) and/or records management system (including patrol logs). Officers may refer to the Report
        Preparation Policy if further information is needed.</p>

    <h3>467.4 POLICE PRESENCE</h3>
    <p>The presence of Metro Transit Police officers while conducting fare inspections will provide security to passengers and Metro Transit personnel. Officers may also be asked to support revenue collection personnel while they, or a vendor, service the
        TVM's.</p>
</div>
            <div class="chapter" id="468">
    <h2>468 - Public Recording of Law Enforcement Activity</h2>
    <h3>468.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>This policy provides guidelines for handling situations in which members of the public photograph or audio/video record law enforcement actions and other public activities that involve members of this department. In addition, this policy provides
        guidelines for situations where the recordings may be evidence.</p>

    <h3>468.2 POLICY</h3>
    <p>The Metro Transit Police Department recognizes the right of persons to lawfully record members of this department who are performing their official duties. Members of this department will not prohibit or intentionally interfere with such lawful recordings.
        Any recordings that are deemed to be evidence of a crime or relevant to an investigation will only be collected or seized lawfully.</p>
    <p>Officers should exercise restraint and should not resort to highly discretionary arrests for offenses such as interference, failure to comply or disorderly conduct as a means of preventing someone from exercising the right to record members performing
        their official duties.</p>

    <h3>468.3 RECORDING LAW ENFORCEMENT ACTIVITY</h3>
    <p>Members of the public who wish to record law enforcement activities are limited only in certain aspects.</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Recordings may be made from any public place or any private property where the individual has the legal right to be present.</li>
        <li>Beyond the act of photographing or recording, individuals may not interfere with the law enforcement activity. Examples of interference include, but are not limited to:
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>Tampering with a witness or suspect.</li>
                <li>Inciting others to violate the law.</li>
                <li>Being so close to the activity as to present a clear safety hazard to the officers.</li>
                <li>Being so close to the activity as to interfere with an officer’s effective communication with a suspect or witness.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>The individual may not present an undue safety risk to the officers, him/herself or others.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>468.4 OFFICER RESPONSE</h3>
    <p>Officers should promptly request a supervisor respond to the scene whenever it appears that anyone recording activities may be interfering with an investigation or it is believed that the recording may be evidence. If practicable, officers should
        wait for the supervisor to arrive before taking enforcement action or seizing any cameras or recording media.</p>
    <p>Whenever practicable, officers or supervisors should give clear and concise warnings to individuals who are conducting themselves in a manner that would cause their recording or behavior to be unlawful. Accompanying the warnings should be clear directions
        on what an individual can do to be compliant; directions should be specific enough to allow compliance. For example, rather than directing an individual to clear the area, an officer could advise the person that he/she may continue observing and
        recording from the sidewalk across the street.</p>
    <p>If an arrest or other significant enforcement activity is taken as the result of a recording that interferes with law enforcement activity, officers shall document in a report the nature and extent of the interference or other unlawful behavior and
        the warnings that were issued.</p>

    <h3>468.5 SUPERVISOR RESPONSIBILITIES</h3>
    <p>A supervisor should respond to the scene when requested or any time the circumstances indicate a likelihood of interference or other unlawful behavior.</p>
    <p>The supervisor should review the situation with the officer and:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Request any additional assistance as needed to ensure a safe environment.</li>
        <li>Take a lead role in communicating with individuals who are observing or recording regarding any appropriate limitations on their location or behavior. When practical, the encounter should be recorded.</li>
        <li>When practicable, allow adequate time for individuals to respond to requests for a change of location or behavior.</li>
        <li>Ensure that any enforcement, seizure or other actions are consistent with this policy and constitutional and state law.</li>
        <li>Explain alternatives for individuals who wish to express concern about the conduct of department members, such as how and where to file a complaint.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>468.6 SEIZING RECORDINGS AS EVIDENCE</h3>
    <p>Officers should not seize recording devices or media unless (42 USC § 2000aa):</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>There is probable cause to believe the person recording has committed or is committing a crime to which the recording relates, and the recording is reasonably necessary for prosecution of the person.
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>Absent exigency or consent, a warrant should be sought before seizing or viewing such recordings. Reasonable steps may be taken to prevent erasure of the recording.</li>

    <h2>469 - Medical Aid and Response</h2>
    <h3>469.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>This policy recognizes that members often encounter persons who appear to be in need of medical aid and establishes a law enforcement response to such situations.</p>

    <h3>469.2 POLICY</h3>
    <p>It is the policy of the Metro Transit Police Department that all officers and other designated members be trained to provide emergency medical aid and to facilitate an emergency medical response.</p>

    <h3>469.3 FIRST RESPONDING MEMBER RESPONSIBILITIES</h3>
    <p>Whenever practicable, members should take appropriate steps to provide initial medical aid (e.g., first aid, CPR and use of an automated external defibrillator (AED)) in accordance with their training and current certification levels. This should
        be done for those in need of immediate care and only when the member can safely do so.</p>
    <p>Prior to initiating medical aid, the member should contact Transit Control Center and request response by emergency medical services (EMS) as the member deems appropriate.</p>
    <p>Members should follow universal precautions when providing medical aid, such as wearing gloves and avoiding contact with bodily fluids, consistent with the Communicable Diseases Policy. Members should use a barrier or bag device to perform rescue
        breathing.</p>
    <p>When requesting EMS, the member should provide Transit Control Center with information for relay to EMS personnel in order to enable an appropriate response, including:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>The location where EMS is needed.</li>
        <li>The nature of the incident.</li>
        <li>Any known scene hazards.</li>
        <li>Information on the person in need of EMS, such as:
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>Signs and symptoms as observed by the member.</li>
                <li>Changes in apparent condition.</li>
                <li>Number of patients, sex and age, if known.</li>
                <li>Whether the person is conscious, breathing and alert, or is believed to have consumed drugs or alcohol.</li>
                <li>Whether the person is showing signs or symptoms of excited delirium or other agitated chaotic behavior.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Members should stabilize the scene whenever practicable while awaiting the arrival of EMS. Members should not direct EMS personnel whether to transport the person for treatment.</p>

    <h3>469.4 TRANSPORTING ILL AND INJURED PERSONS</h3>
    <p>Except in extraordinary cases where alternatives are not reasonably available, members should not transport persons who are unconscious, who have serious injuries or who may be seriously ill. EMS personnel should be called to handle patient transportation.</p>
    <p>Officers should search any person who is in custody before releasing that person to EMS for transport.</p>
    <p>An officer should accompany any person in custody during transport in an ambulance when requested by EMS personnel, when it reasonably appears necessary to provide security, when it is necessary for investigative purposes or when so directed by a
        supervisor.</p>
    <p>Members should not provide emergency escort for medical transport or civilian vehicles.</p>

    <h3>469.5 PERSONS REFUSING EMS CARE</h3>
    <p>If a person who is not in custody refuses EMS care or refuses to be transported to a medical facility, an officer shall not force that person to receive care or be transported. However, members may assist EMS personnel when EMS personnel determine
        the person lacks mental capacity to understand the consequences of refusing medical care or to make an informed decision and the lack of immediate medical attention may result in serious bodily injury or the death of the person.</p>
    <p>In cases where mental illness may be a factor, the officer should consider proceeding with a 72- hour hold in accordance with the Civil Commitments Policy.</p>
    <p>If an officer believes that a person who is in custody requires EMS care and the person refuses, he/she should encourage the person to receive medical treatment. The officer may also consider contacting a family member to help persuade the person
        to agree to treatment or who may be able to authorize treatment for the person.</p>
    <p>If the person still refuses, the officer will require the person to be transported to the nearest medical facility. In such cases, the officer should consult with a supervisor prior to the transport.</p>
    <p>Members shall not sign refusal-for-treatment forms or forms accepting financial responsibility for treatment.</p>
    <h4>469.5.1 SICK OR INJURED ARRESTEE</h4>
    <p>If an arrestee appears ill or injured, or claims illness or injury, he/she should be medically cleared prior to booking. If the officer has reason to believe the arrestee is feigning injury or illness, the officer should contact a supervisor, who
        will determine whether medical clearance will be obtained prior to booking.</p>
    <p>If the jail or detention facility refuses to accept custody of an arrestee based on medical screening, the officer should note the name of the facility person refusing to accept custody and the reason for refusal, and should notify a supervisor to
        determine the appropriate action.</p>
    <p>Arrestees who appear to have a serious medical issue should be transported by ambulance. Officers shall not transport an arrestee to a hospital without a supervisor’s approval.</p>

    <h3>469.6 MEDICAL ATTENTION RELATED TO USE OF FORCE</h3>
    <p>Specific guidelines for medical attention for injuries sustained from a use of force may be found in the Use of Force, Handcuffing and Restraints, Control Devices and Conducted Energy Device policies.</p>

    <h3>469.7 AIR AMBULANCE</h3>
    <p>Generally, when on-scene, EMS personnel will be responsible for determining whether an air ambulance response should be requested. An air ambulance may be appropriate when there are victims with life-threatening injuries or who require specialized
        treatment (e.g., gunshot wounds, burns, obstetrical cases), and distance or other known delays will affect the EMS response.</p>
    <p>The local agency should develop guidelines for air ambulance landings or enter into local operating agreements for the use of air ambulances, as applicable. In creating those guidelines, theDepartment should identify:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Responsibility and authority for designating a landing zone and determining the size of the landing zone.</li>
        <li>Responsibility for securing the area and maintaining that security once the landing zone is identified.</li>
        <li>Consideration of the air ambulance provider’s minimum standards for proximity to vertical obstructions and surface composition (e.g., dirt, gravel, pavement, concrete, grass).</li>
        <li>Consideration of the air ambulance provider’s minimum standards for horizontal clearance from structures, fences, power poles, antennas or roadways.</li>
        <li>Responsibility for notifying the appropriate highway or transportation agencies if a roadway is selected as a landing zone.</li>
        <li>Procedures for ground personnel to communicate with flight personnel during the operation.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>One department member at the scene should be designated as the air ambulance communications contact. Headlights, spotlights and flashlights should not be aimed upward at the air ambulance. Members should direct vehicle and pedestrian traffic away
        from the landing zone.</p>
    <p>Members should follow these cautions when near an air ambulance:</li>
        <ul>
            <li>Never approach the aircraft until signaled by the flight crew.</li>
            <li>Always approach the aircraft from the front.</li>
            <li>Avoid the aircraft’s tail rotor area.</li>
            <li>Wear eye protection during landing and take-off.</li>
            <li>Do not carry or hold items, such as IV bags, above the head.</li>
            <li>Ensure that no one smokes near the aircraft.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>469.8 AUTOMATED EXTERNAL DEFIBRILLATOR (AED) USE</h3>
        <h4>469.8.1 AED USER RESPONSIBILITY</h4>
        <p>Members who are issued AEDs for use in department vehicles should check the AED at the beginning of the shift to ensure it is properly charged and functioning. Any AED that is not functioning properly will be taken out of service and given to
            the Inspections Unit who is responsible for ensuring appropriate maintenance.</p>
        <p>Following use of an AED, the device shall be cleaned and/or decontaminated as required. The electrodes and/or pads will be replaced as recommended by the AED manufacturer.</p>
        <p>Any member who uses an AED should contact Transit Control Center as soon as possible and request response by EMS.</p>
        <h4>469.8.2 AED REPORTING</h4>
        <p>Any member using an AED will complete an incident report detailing its use.</p>
        <h4>469.8.3 AED TRAINING AND MAINTENANCE</h4>
        <p>The Training Supervisor should ensure appropriate training is provided to members authorized to use an AED.</p>
        <p>The Inspections Unit is responsible for ensuring AED devices are appropriately maintained and will retain records of all maintenance in accordance with the established records retention schedule.</p>

    <h2>470 - Crisis Intervention Incidents</h2>
    <h3>470.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>This policy provides guidelines for interacting with those who may be experiencing a mental health or emotional crisis. Interaction with such individuals has the potential for miscommunication and violence. It often requires an officer to make difficult
        judgments about a person’s mental state and intent in order to effectively and legally interact with the individual.</p>
    <h4>470.1.1 DEFINITIONS</h4>
    <p>Definitions related to this policy include:</p>
    <p><strong>Person in crisis</strong> - A person whose level of distress or mental health symptoms have exceeded the person’s internal ability to manage his/her behavior or emotions. A crisis can be precipitated by any number of things, including an increase
        in the symptoms of mental illness despite treatment compliance; non-compliance with treatment, including a failure to take prescribed medications appropriately; or any other circumstance or event that causes the person to engage in erratic, disruptive
        or dangerous behavior that may be accompanied by impaired judgment.</p>

    <h3>470.2 POLICY</h3>
    <p>The Metro Transit Police Department is committed to providing a consistently high level of service to all members of the community and recognizes that persons in crisis may benefit from intervention. The Department will collaborate, where feasible,
        with mental health professionals to develop an overall intervention strategy to guide its members’ interactions with those experiencing a mental health crisis. This is to ensure equitable and safe treatment of all involved.</p>

    <h3>470.3 SIGNS</h3>
    <p>Members should be alert to any of the following possible signs of mental health issues or crises:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>A known history of mental illness</li>
        <li>Threats of or attempted suicide</li>
        <li>Loss of memory</li>
        <li>Incoherence, disorientation or slow response</li>
        <li>Delusions, hallucinations, perceptions unrelated to reality or grandiose ideas</li>
        <li>Depression, pronounced feelings of hopelessness or uselessness, extreme sadness or guilt</li>
        <li>Social withdrawal</li>
        <li>Manic or impulsive behavior, extreme agitation, lack of control</li>
        <li>Lack of fear</li>
        <li>Anxiety, aggression, rigidity, inflexibility or paranoia</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Members should be aware that this list is not exhaustive. The presence or absence of any of these should not be treated as proof of the presence or absence of a mental health issue or crisis.</p>

    <h3>470.4 COORDINATION WITH MENTAL HEALTH PROFESSIONALS</h3>
    <p>The Chief of Police should designate an appropriate Captain to collaborate with mental health professionals to develop an education and response protocol. It should include a list of community resources to guide department interaction with those who
        may be suffering from mental illness or who appear to be in a mental health crisis.</p>

    <h3>470.5 FIRST RESPONDERS</h3>
    <p>Safety is a priority for first responders. It is important to recognize that individuals under the influence of alcohol, drugs or both may exhibit symptoms that are similar to those of a person in a mental health crisis. These individuals may still
        present a serious threat to officers; such a threat should be addressed with reasonable tactics. Nothing in this policy shall be construed to limit an officer’s authority to use reasonable force when interacting with a person in crisis.</p>
    <p>Officers are reminded that mental health issues, mental health crises and unusual behavior alone are not criminal offenses. Individuals may benefit from treatment as opposed to incarceration.</p>
    <p>An officer responding to a call involving a person in crisis should:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Promptly assess the situation independent of reported information and make a preliminary determination regarding whether a mental health crisis may be a factor.</li>
        <li>Request available backup officers and specialized resources as deemed necessary and, if it is reasonably believed that the person is in a crisis situation use conflict resolution and de- escalation techniques to stabilize the incident as appropriate.</li>
        <li>If feasible, and without compromising safety, turn off flashing lights, bright lights or sirens.</li>
        <li>Attempt to determine if weapons are present or available.</li>
        <li>Take into account the person’s mental and emotional state and potential inability to understand commands or to appreciate the consequences of his/her action or inaction, as perceived by the officer.</li>
        <li>Secure the scene and clear the immediate area as necessary.</li>
        <li>Employ tactics to preserve the safety of all participants.</li>
        <li>Determine the nature of any crime.</li>
        <li>Request a supervisor, as warranted.</li>
        <li>Evaluate any available information that might assist in determining cause or motivation for the person’s actions or stated intentions.</li>
        <li>If circumstances reasonably permit, consider and employ alternatives to force.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>470.6 DE-ESCALATION</h3>
    <p>Officers should consider that taking no action or passively monitoring the situation may be the most reasonable response to a mental health crisis.</p>
    <p>Once it is determined that a situation is a mental health crisis and immediate safety concerns have been addressed responding members should be aware of the following considerations and should generally:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Evaluate safety conditions.</li>
        <li>Introduce themselves and attempt to obtain the person’s name.</li>
        <li>Be patient, polite, calm, courteous and avoid overreacting.</li>
        <li>Speak and move slowly and in a non-threatening manner.</li>
        <li>Moderate the level of direct eye contact.</li>
        <li>Remove distractions or disruptive people from the area.</li>
        <li>Demonstrate active listening skills (e.g., summarize the person’s verbal communication).</li>
        <li>Provide for sufficient avenues of retreat or escape should the situation become volatile.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Responding officers generally should not:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Use stances or tactics that can be interpreted as aggressive.</li>
        <li>Allow others to interrupt or engage the person.</li>
        <li>Corner a person who is not believed to be armed, violent or suicidal.</li>
        <li>Argue, speak with a raised voice or use threats to obtain compliance.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>470.7 INCIDENT ORIENTATION</h3>
    <p>When responding to an incident that may involve mental illness or a mental health crisis, the officer should request that the dispatcher provide critical information as it becomes available. This includes:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Whether the person relies on drugs or medication, or may have failed to take his/her medication.</li>
        <li>Whether there have been prior incidents, suicide threats/attempts, and whether there has been previous police response.</li>
        <li>Contact information for a treating physician or mental health professional.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Additional resources (e.g. personnel with additional/advanced crisis intervention training) and a supervisor should be requested as warranted.</p>

    <h3>470.8 SUPERVISOR RESPONSIBILITIES</h3>
    <p>A supervisor should respond to the scene of any interaction with a person in crisis. Responding supervisors should:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Attempt to secure appropriate and sufficient resources (e.g. personnel with additional/ advanced crisis intervention training and/or medical personnel).</li>
        <li>Closely monitor any use of force, including the use of restraints, and ensure that those subjected to the use of force are provided with timely access to medical care (see the Handcuffing and Restraints Policy).</li>
        <li>Consider strategic disengagement. Absent an imminent threat to the public and, as circumstances dictate, this may include removing or reducing law enforcement resources or engaging in passive monitoring.</li>
        <li>Ensure that all reports are completed and that incident documentation uses appropriate terminology and language.</li>
        <li>Conduct an after-action tactical and operational debriefing, and prepare an after-action evaluation of the incident to be forwarded to the Captain.</li>
        <li>Evaluate whether a critical incident stress management debriefing for involved members is warranted.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>470.7 INCIDENT REPORTING</h3>
    <p>Members engaging in any oral or written communication associated with a mental health crisis should be mindful of the sensitive nature of such communications and should exercise appropriate discretion when referring to or describing persons and circumstances.</p>
    <p>Members having contact with a person in crisis should keep related information confidential, except to the extent that revealing information is necessary to conform to department reporting procedures or other official mental health or medical proceedings.</p>
    <h4>470.7.1 DIVERSION</h4>
    <p>Individuals who are not being arrested should be processed in accordance with the Civil Commitments Policy.</p>

    <h3>470.10 NON-LICENSED INTERACTION WITH PEOPLE IN CRISIS</h3>
    <p>Non-licensed members may be required to interact with persons in crisis in an administrative capacity, such as dispatching, records request, and animal control issues.</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Members should treat all individuals equally and with dignity and respect.</li>
        <li>If a member believes that he/she is interacting with a person in crisis, he/she should proceed patiently and in a calm manner.</li>
        <li>Members should be aware and understand that the person may make unusual or bizarre claims or requests.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If a person’s behavior makes the member feel unsafe, if the person is or becomes disruptive or violent, or if the person acts in such a manner as to cause the member to believe that the person may be harmful to him/herself or others, an officer should
        be promptly summoned to provide assistance.</p>

    <h3>470.11 EVALUATION</h3>
    <p>The Captain designated to coordinate the crisis intervention strategy for this department should ensure that a thorough review and analysis of the department response to these incidents is conducted annually. The report will not include identifying
        information pertaining to any involved individuals, officers or incidents and will be submitted to the Chief of Police through the chain of command.</p>

    <h3>470.12 TRAINING</h3>
    <p>In coordination with the mental health community and appropriate stakeholders, the Department will develop and provide education and training to all department members to enable them to effectively interact with persons in crisis.</p>
</div>
            <div class="chapter" id="471">
    <h2>471 - Civil Disputes</h2>
    <h3>471.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>This policy provides members of the Metro Transit Police Department with guidance for addressing conflicts between persons when no criminal investigation or enforcement action is warranted (e.g., civil matters), with the goal of minimizing any potential
        for violence or criminal acts.</p>
    <p>The Domestic Abuse Policy will address specific legal mandates related to domestic violence court orders. References in this policy to “court orders” apply to any order of a court that does not require arrest or enforcement by the terms of the order
        or by Minnesota law.</p>

    <h3>471.2 POLICY</h3>
    <p>The Metro Transit Police Department recognizes that a law enforcement presence at a civil dispute can play an important role in the peace and safety of the community. Subject to available resources, members of this department will assist at the scene
        of civil disputes with the primary goal of safeguarding persons and property, preventing criminal activity and maintaining the peace. When handling civil disputes, members will remain impartial, maintain a calm presence, give consideration to
        all sides and refrain from giving legal or inappropriate advice.</p>

    <h3>471.3 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS</h3>
    <p>When appropriate, members handling a civil dispute should encourage the involved parties to seek the assistance of resolution services or take the matter to the civil courts. Members must not become personally involved in disputes and shall at all
        times remain impartial.</p>
    <p>While not intended to be an exhaustive list, members should give considerations to the following when handling civil disputes:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Civil disputes tend to be confrontational and members should be alert that they can escalate to violence very quickly. De-escalation techniques should be used when appropriate.</li>
        <li>Members should not dismiss alleged or observed criminal violations as a civil matter and should initiate the appropriate investigation and report when criminal activity is apparent.</li>
        <li>Members shall not provide legal advice, however, when appropriate, members should inform the parties when they are at risk of violating criminal laws.</li>
        <li>Members are reminded that they shall not enter a residence or other non-public location without legal authority including valid consent.</li>
        <li>Members should not take an unreasonable amount of time assisting in these matters and generally should contact a supervisor if it appears that peacekeeping efforts longer than 30 minutes are warranted.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>471.4 COURT ORDERS</h3>
    <p>Disputes involving court orders can be complex. Where no mandate exists for an officer to make an arrest for a violation of a court order, the matter should be addressed by documenting any apparent</p>
    <p>court order violation in a report. If there appears to be a more immediate need for enforcement action, the investigating officer should consult a supervisor prior to making any arrest.</p>
    <p>If a person appears to be violating the terms of a court order but is disputing the validity of the order or its applicability, the investigating officer should document the following:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>The person’s knowledge of the court order or whether proof of service exists.</li>
        <li>Any specific reason or rationale the involved person offers for not complying with the terms of the order.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>A copy of the court order should be attached to the report when available. The report should be forwarded to the appropriate prosecutor. The report should also be forwarded to the court issuing the order with a notice that the report was also forwarded
        to the prosecutor for review.</p>
    <h4>471.4.1   STANDBY REQUESTS</h4>
    <p>Officers responding to a call for standby assistance to retrieve property should meet the person requesting assistance at a neutral location to discuss the process. The person should be advised that items that are disputed will not be allowed to be
        removed. The member may advise the person to seek private legal advice as to the distribution of disputed property.</p>
    <p>Members should accompany the person to the location of the property. Members should ask if the other party will allow removal of the property or whether the other party would remove the property.</p>
    <p>If the other party is uncooperative, the person requesting standby assistance should be instructed to seek private legal advice and obtain a court order to obtain the items. Officers should not order the other party to allow entry or the removal of
        any items. If there is a restraining or similar order against the person requesting standby assistance, that person should be asked to leave the scene or they may be subject to arrest for violation of the order.</p>
    <p>If the other party is not present at the location, the member will not allow entry into the location or the removal of property from the location.</p>

    <h3>471.5 VEHICLES AND PERSONAL PROPERTY</h3>
    <p>Officers may be faced with disputes regarding possession or ownership of vehicles or other personal property. Officers may review documents provided by parties or available databases (e.g., vehicle registration), but should be aware that legal possession
        of vehicles or personal property can be complex. Generally, officers should not take any enforcement action unless a crime is apparent. The people and the vehicle or personal property involved should be identified and the incident documented.</p>

    <h3>471.6 REAL PROPERTY</h3>
    <p>Disputes over possession or occupancy of real property (e.g., land, homes, apartments) should generally be handled through a person seeking a court order.</p>

    <h2>472 - Suspicious Activity Reporting</h2>
    <h3>472.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>This policy provides guidelines for reporting and investigating suspicious and criminal activity.</p>
    <h4>472.1.1 DEFINITIONS</h4>
    <p>Definitions related to this policy include:</p>
    <p><strong>Involved party</strong> - An individual who has been observed engaging in suspicious activity, as defined in this policy, when no definitive criminal activity can be identified, thus precluding the person’s identification as a suspect.</p>
    <p><strong>Suspicious activity</strong> - Any reported or observed activity that a member reasonably believes may have a nexus to any criminal act or attempted criminal act, or to foreign or domestic terrorism. Race, ethnicity, national origin or religious
        affiliation should not be considered as factors that create suspicion (although these factors may be used as specific suspect descriptions). Examples of suspicious activity may include, but are not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Suspected pre-operational surveillance or intelligence gathering (e.g., photographing security features, asking questions about sensitive security-related subjects).</li>
        <li>Tests of security measures and response to incidents (e.g., “dry run,” creating false alarms, attempts to enter secure areas without authorization).</li>
        <li>Suspicious purchases (e.g., purchasing large quantities of otherwise legal items, such as fertilizer, that could be used to create an explosive or other dangerous device).</li>
        <li>An individual in possession of such things as a hoax explosive or dispersal device, sensitive materials (e.g., passwords, access codes, classified government information), or coded or ciphered literature or correspondence.</li>

    </ul>
    <p><strong>Suspicious Activity Report (SAR)</strong> - An incident report used to document suspicious activity.</p>

    <h3>472.2 POLICY</h3>
    <p>The Metro Transit Police Department recognizes the need to protect the public from criminal conduct and acts of terrorism and shall lawfully collect, maintain and disseminate information regarding suspicious activities, while safeguarding civil liberties
        and privacy protections.</p>

    <h3>472.3 RESPONSIBILITIES</h3>
    <p>The Criminal Investigations supervisor and authorized designees will manage SAR activities. Authorized designees should include supervisors who are responsible for department participation in criminal intelligence systems as outlined in the Criminal
        Organizations Policy.</p>
    <p>The responsibilities of the Criminal Investigations supervisor include, but are not limited to:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Remaining familiar with those databases available to the Department that would facilitate the purpose of this policy.</li>
        <li>Maintaining adequate training in the area of intelligence gathering to ensure no information is being maintained that would violate the law or civil rights of any individual.</li>
        <li>Ensuring a process is available that would allow members to report relevant information. The process should be designed to promote efficient and quick reporting, and should not be cumbersome, duplicative or complicated.</li>
        <li>Ensuring that members are made aware of the purpose and value of documenting information regarding suspicious activity, as well as the databases and other information resources that are available to the Department.</li>
        <li>Ensuring that SAR information is appropriately disseminated to members in accordance with their job responsibilities.</li>
        <li>Coordinating investigative follow-up, if appropriate.</li>
        <li>Coordinating with any appropriate agency or fusion center.</li>
        <li>Ensuring that, as resources are available, the Department conducts outreach that is designed to encourage members of the community to report suspicious activity and that outlines what they should look for and how they should report it (e.g., website,
            public service announcements).</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>472.4 REPORTING AND INVESTIGATION</h3>
    <p>Any department member receiving information regarding suspicious activity should take any necessary immediate and appropriate action, including a request for tactical response or immediate notification of specialized entities, when applicable. Any
        non-licensed member who receives such information should ensure that it is passed on to an officer in a timely manner.</p>
    <p>If the suspicious activity is not directly related to a reportable crime, the member should prepare a SAR and include information about involved parties and the circumstances of the incident. If, during any investigation, an officer becomes aware
        of suspicious activity that is unrelated to the current investigation, the information should be documented separately in a SAR and not included in the original incident report. The report number of the original incident should be included in
        the SAR as a cross reference. A SAR should be processed as any other incident report.</p>

    <h3>472.5 HANDLING INFORMATION</h3>
    <p>The Records Section will forward copies of SARs, in a timely manner, to the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Investigation Division supervisor</li>
        <li>Crime Analysis Unit</li>
        <li>Other authorized designees</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>473 - First Amendment Assemblies</h2>
    <h3>473.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>This policy provides guidance for responding to public assemblies or demonstrations.</p>

    <h3>473.2 POLICY</h3>
    <p>The Metro Transit Police Department respects the rights of people to peaceably assemble. It is the policy of this department not to unreasonably interfere with, harass, intimidate or discriminate against persons engaged in the lawful exercise of their
        rights, while also preserving the peace, protecting life and preventing the destruction of property.</p>

    <h3>473.3 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS</h3>
    <p>Individuals or groups present on the public way, such as public facilities, streets or walkways, generally have the right to assemble, rally, demonstrate, protest or otherwise express their views and opinions through varying forms of communication,
        including the distribution of printed matter. These rights may be limited by laws or ordinances regulating such matters as the obstruction of individual or vehicle access or egress, trespass, noise, picketing, distribution of handbills, leafleting
        and loitering. However, officers shall not take action or fail to take action based on the opinions being expressed.</p>
    <p>Participant behavior during a demonstration or other public assembly can vary. This may include, but is not limited to:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Lawful, constitutionally protected actions and speech.</li>
        <li>Civil disobedience (typically involving minor criminal acts).</li>
        <li>Rioting.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All of these behaviors may be present during the same event. Therefore, it is imperative that law enforcement actions are measured and appropriate for the behaviors officers may encounter. This is particularly critical if force is being used. Adaptable
        strategies and tactics are essential. The purpose of a law enforcement presence at the scene of public assemblies and demonstrations should be to preserve the peace, to protect life and prevent the destruction of property.</p>
    <p>Officers should not:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Engage in assembly or demonstration-related discussion with participants.</li>
        <li>Harass, confront or intimidate participants.</li>
        <li>Seize the cameras, cell phones or materials of participants or observers unless an officer is placing a person under lawful arrest.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Supervisors should continually observe department members under their commands to ensure that members’ interaction with participants and their response to crowd dynamics is appropriate.</p>
    <h4>473.3.1 PHOTOGRAPHS AND VIDEO RECORDINGS</h4>
    <p>Photographs and video recording, when appropriate, can serve a number of purposes, including support of criminal prosecutions by documenting criminal acts; assistance in evaluating department performance; serving as training material; recording the
        use of dispersal orders; and facilitating a response to allegations of improper law enforcement conduct.</p>
    <p>Photographs and videos will not be used or retained for the sole purpose of collecting or maintaining information about the political, religious or social views of associations, or the activities of any individual, group, association, organization,
        corporation, business or partnership, unless such information directly relates to an investigation of criminal activities and there is reasonable suspicion that the subject of the information is involved in criminal conduct.</p>

    <h3>473.4 UNPLANNED EVENTS</h3>
    <p>When responding to an unplanned or spontaneous public gathering, the first responding officer should conduct an assessment of conditions, including, but not limited to, the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Location</li>
        <li>Number of participants</li>
        <li>Apparent purpose of the event</li>
        <li>Leadership (whether it is apparent and/or whether it is effective)</li>
        <li>Any initial indicators of unlawful or disruptive activity</li>
        <li>Indicators that lawful use of public facilities, streets or walkways will be impacted</li>
        <li>Ability and/or need to continue monitoring the incident</li>
    </ul>
    <p>Initial assessment information should be promptly communicated to Transit Control Center, and the assignment of a supervisor should be requested. Additional resources should be requested as appropriate. The responding supervisor shall assume command
        of the incident until command is expressly assumed by another, and the assumption of command is communicated to the involved members. A clearly defined command structure that is consistent with the Incident Command System (ICS) should be established
        as resources are deployed.</p>

    <h3>473.5 PLANNED EVENT PREPARATION</h3>
    <p>For planned events, comprehensive, incident-specific operational plans should be developed. The ICS should be considered for such events.</p>
    <h4>473.5.1 INFORMATION GATHERING AND ASSESSMENT</h3>
							                                <p>In order to properly assess the potential impact of a public assembly or demonstration on public safety and order, relevant information should be collected and vetted. This may include:</p>
							                                <ul>
														        <li>Information obtained from outreach to group organizers or leaders.</li>
														        <li>Information about past and potential unlawful conduct associated with the event or similar events.</li>
														        <li>The potential time, duration, scope and type of planned activities.</li>
														        <li>Any other information related to the goal of providing a balanced response to criminal activity and the protection of public safety interests.</li>
														    </ul>
														    <p>Information should be obtained in a transparent manner, and the sources documented. Relevant information should be communicated to the appropriate parties in a timely manner.</p>
														    <p>Information will be obtained in a lawful manner and will not be based solely on the purpose or content of the assembly or demonstration, or the race, ethnicity, national origin or religion of the participants (or any other characteristic that is unrelated to criminal conduct or the identification of a criminal subject).</p>
										                    <h3>473.5.2 OPERATIONAL PLANS</h3>
										                    <p>An operational planning team with responsibility for event planning and management should be established. The planning team should develop an operational plan for the event.</p>
										                    <p>The operational plan will minimally provide for the following:</p>
										                    <ol class="alpha">
										                        <li>Command assignments, chain of command structure, roles and responsibilities</li>
										                        <li>Staffing and resource allocation</li>
										                        <li>Management of criminal investigations</li>
										                        <li>Designation of uniform of the day and related safety equipment (e.g., helmets, shields)</li>
										                        <li>Deployment of specialized resources</li>
										                        <li>Event communications and interoperability in a multijurisdictional event</li>
										                        <li>Liaison with demonstration leaders and external agencies</li>
										                        <li>Liaison with Metropolitan Area government and legal staff</li>
										                        <li>Media relations</li>
										                        <li>Logistics: food, fuel, replacement equipment, duty hours, relief and transportation</li>
										                        <li>Traffic management plans</li>
										                        <li>First aid and emergency medical service provider availability</li>
										                        <li>Prisoner transport and detention</li>
										                        <li>Review of policies regarding public assemblies and use of force in crowd control</li>
										                        <li>Parameters for declaring an unlawful assembly</li>
										                        <li>Arrest protocol, including management of mass arrests</li>
										                        <li>Protocol for recording information flow and decisions</li>
										                        <li>Rules of engagement, including rules of conduct, protocols for field force extraction and arrests, and any authorization required for the use of force</li>
										                        <li>Protocol for handling complaints during the event</li>
										                    </ol>
										                    <h4>473.5.3 MUTUAL AID AND EXTERNAL RESOURCES</h4>
    <p>The magnitude and anticipated duration of an event may necessitate interagency cooperation and coordination. The assigned Incident Commander should ensure that any required memorandums of understanding or other agreements are properly executed, and
        that any anticipated mutual aid is requested and facilitated (see the Outside Agency Assistance Policy).</p>

    <h3>473.6 UNLAWFUL ASSEMBLY DISPERSAL ORDERS</h3>
    <p>If a public gathering or demonstration remains peaceful and nonviolent, and there is no reasonably imminent threat to persons or property, the Incident Commander should generally authorize continued monitoring of the event.</p>
    <p>Should the Incident Commander make a determination that public safety is presently or is about to be jeopardized, he/she or the authorized designee should attempt to verbally persuade event organizers or participants to disperse of their own accord.
        Warnings and advisements may be communicated through established communications links with leaders and/or participants or to the group.</p>
    <p>When initial attempts at verbal persuasion are unsuccessful, the Incident Commander or the authorized designee should make a clear standardized announcement to the gathering that the event is an unlawful assembly, and should order the dispersal of
        the participants. The announcement should be communicated by whatever methods are reasonably available to ensure that the content of the message is clear and that it has been heard by the participants. The announcement should be amplified, made
        in different languages as appropriate, made from multiple locations in the affected area and documented by audio and video. The announcement should provide information about what law enforcement actions will take place if illegal behavior continues
        and should identify routes for egress. A reasonable time to disperse should be allowed following a dispersal order.</p>

    <h3>473.7 USE OF FORCE</h3>
    <p>Use of force is governed by current department policy and applicable law (see the Use of Force, Handcuffing and Restraints, Control Devices and Techniques, and Conducted Energy Device policies).</p>
    <p>Individuals refusing to comply with lawful orders (e.g., nonviolent refusal to disperse) should be given a clear verbal warning and a reasonable opportunity to comply. If an individual refuses to comply with lawful orders, the Incident Commander shall
        evaluate the type of resistance and adopt a reasonable response in order to accomplish the law enforcement mission (such as dispersal or arrest of those acting in violation of the law). Control devices and Conducted Energy Device (CED)s should
        be considered only when the participants’ conduct reasonably appears to present the potential to harm officers, themselves or others, or will result in substantial property loss or damage (see the Control Devices and Techniques and the Conducted
        Energy Device policies).</p>
    <p>Force or control devices, including oleoresin capsaicin (OC), should be directed toward individuals and not toward groups or crowds, unless specific individuals cannot reasonably be targeted due to extreme circumstances, such as a riotous crowd.</p>
    <p>Any use of force by a member of this department shall be documented promptly, completely and accurately in an appropriate report. The type of report required may depend on the nature of the incident.</p>

    <h3>473.8 ARRESTS</h3>
    <p>The Metro Transit Police Department should respond to unlawful behavior in a manner that is consistent with the operational plan. If practicable, warnings or advisements should be communicated prior to arrest.</p>
    <p>Mass arrests should be employed only when alternate tactics and strategies have been, or reasonably appear likely to be, unsuccessful. Mass arrests shall only be undertaken upon the order of the Incident Commander or the authorized designee. There
        must be probable cause for each arrest.</p>
    <p>If employed, mass arrest protocols should fully integrate:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Reasonable measures to address the safety of officers and arrestees.</li>
        <li>Dedicated arrest, booking and report writing teams.</li>
        <li>Timely access to medical care.</li>
        <li>Timely access to legal resources.</li>
        <li>Timely processing of arrestees.</li>
        <li>Full accountability for arrestees and evidence.</li>
        <li>Coordination and cooperation with the prosecuting authority, jail and courts (see the Citation Releases Policy).</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>473.9 MEDIA RELATIONS</h3>
    <p>The Public Information Officer should use all available avenues of communication, including press releases, briefings, press conferences and social media to maintain open channels of communication with media representatives and the public about the
        status and progress of the event, taking all opportunities to reassure the public about the professional management of the event (see the Media Relations Policy).</p>

    <h3>473.10 DEMOBILIZATION</h3>
    <p>When appropriate, the Incident Commander or the authorized designee should implement a phased and orderly withdrawal of law enforcement resources. All relieved personnel should promptly complete any required reports, including use of force reports,
        and account for all issued equipment and vehicles to their supervisors prior to returning to normal operational duties.</p>

    <h3>473.11 POST EVENT</h3>
    <p>The Incident Commander should designate a member to assemble full documentation of the event, to include the following:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Operational plan</li>
        <li>Any incident logs</li>
        <li>Any assignment logs</li>
        <li>Vehicle, fuel, equipment and supply records</li>
        <li>Incident, arrest, use of force, injury and property damage reports</li>
        <li>Photographs, audio/video recordings, Transit Control Center records/tapes</li>
        <li>Media accounts (print and broadcast media)</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>473.11.1 AFTER-ACTION REPORTING</h4>
    <p>The Incident Commander should work with Metropolitan Council legal counsel, if needed and as appropriate, to prepare a comprehensive after-action report of the event, explaining all incidents where force was used including the following:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Date, time and description of the event</li>
        <li>Actions taken and outcomes (e.g., injuries, property damage, arrests)</li>
        <li>Problems identified</li>
        <li>Significant events</li>
        <li>Recommendations for improvement; opportunities for training should be documented in a generic manner, without identifying individuals or specific incidents, facts or circumstances.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>473.12 TRAINING</h3>
    <p>Department members should receive periodic training regarding this policy, as well as the dynamics of crowd control and incident management. The Department should, when practicable, train with its external and mutual aid partners.</p>
</div>
            <div class="chapter" id="474">
    <h2>474 - Medical Cannabis</h2>
    <h3>474.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this policy is to provide members of this department with guidelines for investigating the possession or use of medical cannabis under Minnesota’s medical cannabis laws.</p>
    <h4>474.1.1 DEFINITIONS</h4>
    <p>Definitions related to this policy include (Minn. Stat. § 152.22):</p>
    <p><strong>Medical cannabis</strong> - Any species of the genus cannabis plant, or any mixture or preparation of them, including whole plant extracts and resins in the form of a liquid, oil or pill, that is properly packaged and labeled with:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>The name and address of the authorized manufacturer.</li>
        <li>The patient’s registry identification number, name, date of birth and address.</li>
        <li>The chemical composition of medical cannabis.</li>
        <li>Recommended dosage.</li>
        <li>Directions for use.</li>
        <li>Batch number.</li>
        <li>Date of manufacture.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Raw leaves, flowers and edibles are not included.</p>
    <p><strong>Patient</strong> - A Minnesota resident who has been diagnosed with a qualifying medical condition by a health care practitioner and who has met any other requirements for patients under Minn. Stat. § 152.22 et seq.</p>
    <p><strong>Caregiver</strong> - A person who has been approved by the Minnesota Commissioner of Health to assist a patient who is unable to self-administer medication or acquire medical cannabis from a distribution facility due to a disability, and who
        is authorized to assist the patient with the use of medical cannabis.</p>

    <h3>474.2 POLICY</h3>
    <p>It is the policy of the Metro Transit Police Department to prioritize resources to avoid making arrests related to medical cannabis that the arresting officer reasonably believes would not be prosecuted by state or federal authorities.</p>
    <p>Minnesota medical cannabis laws are intended to provide protection from prosecution to those who use or possess medical cannabis for medical purposes. The Metro Transit Police Department will exercise discretion to ensure laws are appropriately enforced
        without unreasonably burdening both those individuals protected under Minnesota law and the resources of the Department.</p>

    <h3>474.3 INVESTIGATION</h3>
    <p>Investigations involving the possession or use of cannabis generally fall into one of two categories:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Investigations when no person makes a medicinal claim.</li>
        <li>Investigations when a person claims to be a patient or caregiver.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>474.3.1 INVESTIGATIONS WITH NO MEDICAL CLAIM</h4>
    <p>In any investigation involving the possession, delivery, production or use of a cannabis product or drug paraphernalia where no person claims that the cannabis is used for medicinal purposes, the officer should proceed with a criminal investigation.
        A medicinal claim may be raised at any time, so officers should document any statements and observations that may be relevant to whether the cannabis was possessed or produced for medicinal purposes.</p>
    <h4>474.3.2 INVESTIGATIONS INVOLVING A PATIENT OR CAREGIVER</h4>
    <p>Arrest shall not be made for the possession of medical cannabis by a patient, a caregiver or the parent or legal guardian of a patient (Minn. Stat. § 152.32).</p>
    <p>Possession of medical cannabis properly packaged and labeled by an authorized manufacturer should suffice for verification of a person’s status as a patient. The possession of medical cannabis registry verification from the Minnesota Department of
        Health should also suffice for verification a person’s status as a patient or caregiver (Minn. Stat. § 152.22; Minn. Stat. § 152.27).</p>
    <h4>474.3.3 EXCEPTIONS</h4>
    <p>This policy does not apply to the following offenses. Officers may take enforcement action if the person (Minn. Stat. § 152.23):</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Possesses or engages in the use of medical cannabis on a school bus or van, on the grounds of any preschool or primary or secondary school, in any correctional facility, or on the grounds of any child care facility or home daycare.</li>
        <li>Vaporizes medical cannabis on any form of public transportation, where the vapor would be inhaled by a non-patient minor child, or in any public place or a place of employment.</li>
        <li>Operates any motor vehicle, aircraft, train or motorboat, or works on transportation property, equipment or facilities while under the influence of medical cannabis.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>474.4 FEDERAL LAW ENFORCEMENT</h3>
    <p>Officers should provide information regarding a medical cannabis investigation to federal law enforcement authorities when it is requested by federal law enforcement authorities or whenever the officer believes those authorities would have a particular
        interest in the information.</p>

    <h3>474.5 PROPERTY AND EVIDENCE SUPERVISOR RESPONSIBILITIES</h3>
    <p>The Property and Evidence supervisor shall ensure that medical cannabis, drug paraphernalia or other related property seized from a person engaged or assisting in the use of medical cannabis is not destroyed. Upon the prosecutor’s decision to forgo
        prosecution, or the dismissal of charges or an acquittal, the Property and Evidence supervisor shall as soon as practicable return to the person from whom it was seized any medical cannabis, drug paraphernalia or other related property.</p>
    <p>The Property and Evidence supervisor may not destroy medical cannabis except upon receipt of a court order.</p>
    <p>The Property and Evidence supervisor may release medical cannabis to federal law enforcement authorities upon presentation of a valid court order or by a written order of the Investigation Division supervisor.</p>
</div>

            <div class="chapter" id="500">
    <h2>500 - Traffic Function and Responsibility</h2>
    <h3>500.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>The ultimate goal of traffic law enforcement is to reduce traffic collisions. This may be achieved through the application of such techniques as geographic/temporal assignment of personnel and equipment and the establishment of preventative patrols
        to deal with specific categories of unlawful driving behavior. Traffic enforcement techniques are based on collision data, enforcement activity records, traffic volume and traffic conditions. This department provides enforcement efforts toward
        violations, not only in proportion to the frequency of their occurrence in collision situations but also in terms of traffic-related needs.</p>

    <h3>500.2 TRAFFIC OFFICER DEPLOYMENT</h3>
    <p>Several factors are considered in the development of deployment schedules for officers of the Metro Transit Police Department. Information provided by the Minnesota Office of Traffic Safety (OTS) is a valuable resource for traffic collision occurrences
        and therefore officer deployment. Some of the factors for analysis include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Location</li>
        <li>Time</li>
        <li>Day</li>
        <li>Violation factors</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All officers assigned to patrol or traffic enforcement functions will emphasize enforcement of collision-causing violations during periods of high-collision incidence and at locations of occurrence. All officers will take directed enforcement action
        on request, and random enforcement action when appropriate, against violators as a matter of routine. All officers shall maintain high visibility while working general enforcement, especially at high-collision incidence locations.</p>
    <p>Other factors to be considered for deployment are citizen requests, construction zones or special events.</p>

    <h3>500.3 ENFORCEMENT</h3>
    <p>Enforcement actions are commensurate with applicable laws and take into account the degree and severity of the violation committed. This department does not establish ticket quotas and the number of citations issued by any officer shall not be used
        when evaluating officer performance (Minn. Stat. § 169.985; Minn. Stat. § 299D.08). The visibility and quality of an officer’s work effort will be commensurate with the philosophy of this policy. Several methods are effective in the reduction
        of collisions:</p>
    <h4>500.3.1 WARNINGS</h4>
    <p>Warnings or other non-punitive enforcement actions should be considered in each situation and substituted for arrests or citations when circumstances warrant.</p>
    <h4>500.3.2 TRAFFIC CITATIONS</h4>
    <p>Traffic citations may be issued when an officer believes it is appropriate. It is essential that officers fully explain the rights and requirements imposed on motorists upon issuance of a citation for a traffic violation. Officers should provide the
        following information at a minimum:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Explanation of the violation or charge.</li>
        <li>Court appearance procedure, including the optional or mandatory appearance by the motorist.</li>
        <li>Notice of whether the motorist can enter a plea and pay the fine by mail or at the court.</li>
        <li>The court contact information.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>500.3.3 TRAFFIC CITATION COURT JURISDICTION</h4>
    <p>An officer who issues a traffic citation shall ensure that the citation is properly directed to the court having jurisdiction (Minn. Stat. § 169.91 Subd. 3).</p>
    <h4>500.3.4 PHYSICAL ARREST</h4>
    <p>Physical arrest can be made on a number of criminal traffic offenses. These physical arrest cases usually deal with, but are not limited to (Minn. Stat. § 169.91):</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Negligent homicide.</li>
        <li>Driving under the influence of alcohol/drugs.</li>
        <li>Hit-and-run resulting in serious injury or death.</li>
        <li>Hit-and-run resulting in damage to any vehicle or property.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>500.4 HIGH-VISIBILITY VESTS</h3>
    <p>The Department has provided American National Standards Institute (ANSI) Class II high-visibility vests to increase the visibility of department members who may be exposed to hazards presented by passing traffic, maneuvering or operating vehicles,
        machinery and equipment (23 CFR 655.601; Minn. R. 5205.0030).</p>
    <p>Although intended primarily for use while performing traffic-related assignments, high-visibility vests should be worn at any time increased visibility would improve the safety or efficiency of the member.</p>
    <h4>500.4.1 REQUIRED USE</h4>
    <p>Except when working in a potentially adversarial or confrontational role, such as during vehicle stops, high-visibility vests should be worn at any time it is anticipated that an employee will be exposed to the hazards of approaching traffic or construction
        and recovery equipment. Examples of when high-visibility vests should be worn include traffic control duties, collision investigations, lane closures and while at disaster scenes, or any time high visibility is desirable. When emergency conditions
        preclude the immediate donning of the vest, officers should retrieve and wear the vest as soon as conditions reasonably permit. Use of the vests shall also be mandatory when directed by a supervisor.</p>
    <p>Vests maintained in the investigation units may be used any time a plain clothes officer might benefit from being readily identified as an officer.</p>
    <h4>500.4.2 CARE AND STORAGE OF HIGH-VISIBILITY VESTS</h4>
    <p>High-visibility vests shall be maintained in the trunk of each patrol and investigation unit, in the side box of each police motorcycle and in the saddlebag or gear bag of each police bicycle. Each vest should be stored inside the resealable plastic
        bag provided to protect and maintain the vest in a serviceable condition. Before going into service each employee shall ensure a serviceable high-visibility vest is properly stored.</p>
    <p>A supply of high-visibility vests will be maintained in the equipment room for replacement of damaged or unserviceable vests. The Training Supervisor should be promptly notified whenever the supply of vests in the equipment room needs replenishing.</p>

    <h3>502.3 RESPONSE</h3>
    <p>Upon arriving at the scene, the responding member should assess the need for additional resources and summon assistance as appropriate. Generally, the member initially dispatched to the scene will be responsible for the investigation and report, if
        required, unless responsibility is reassigned by a supervisor.</p>
    <p>A supervisor should notified when the incident:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Is within the jurisdiction of this department and there is:

Members may provide assistance to motorists as a public service, such as exchanging information and arranging for the removal of the vehicles.</p>
										                    <h4>502.5.2 METROPOLITAN COUNCIL / METRO TRANSIT VEHICLE INVOLVED</h4>
    <p>A State crash report shall be taken when a Metropolitan Council / Metro Transit vehicle is involved in a traffic collision that results in property damage or injury. In cases where minor damage has occurred to Metropolitan Council / Metro Transit
        property only, a Supervisor may complete the State crash report in lieu of an outside agency completing the report.</p>
    <p>Whenever there is damage to a Metropolitan Council / Metro Transit vehicle, a police report shall be completed and forwarded to the appropriate Captain. The traffic investigator or supervisor at the scene should determine what photographs should be
        taken of the scene and the vehicle damage.</p>
    <h4>502.5.3 INJURED ANIMALS</h4>
    <p>Department members should refer to the Firearms Policy (312.7.2 Injured Animals) when a traffic collision involves the disposition of an injured animal.</p>

    <h3>502.6 INVESTIGATION</h3>
    <p>When a traffic collision meets minimum reporting requirements the investigation should include, at a minimum:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Identification and interview of all involved parties.</li>
        <li>Identification and interview of any witnesses.</li>
        <li>A determination of whether a violation of law has occurred and the appropriate enforcement action.</li>
        <li>Identification and protection of items of apparent evidentiary value.</li>
        <li>Documentation of the incident as necessary (e.g., statements, measurements, photographs, collection of evidence and reporting) on the appropriate forms.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>502.6.1 INVESTIGATION BY OUTSIDE LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCY</h4>
    <p>The Patrol Supervisor or on-duty Shift Supervisor should request that the Minnesota Department of Public Safety (State Patrol) or other outside law enforcement agency investigate and complete a traffic collision investigation when a personal injury

    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>An on- or off-duty member of the Department.
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>The involved member shall complete the department traffic collision form. If the member is unable to complete the form, the supervisor shall complete it.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>An on-or off-duty official or employee of the Metropolitan Council / Metro Transit.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Department members shall promptly notify a supervisor when any department vehicle is involved in a traffic collision. The collision investigation and report shall be completed by the agency having jurisdiction.</p>
    <h4>502.6.2 COMMERCIAL VEHICLE COLLISIONS</h4>
    <p>Commercial vehicle collisions additionally require notification to the Minnesota State Patrol if the collision results in (Minn. Stat. § 169.783):</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>A fatality.</li>
        <li>Bodily injury to a person who, as a result of the injury, immediately receives medical treatment away from the scene of the collision.</li>
        <li>One or more vehicles incurring disabling damage as a result of the collision, requiring the vehicle to be transported away from the scene by tow truck or other motor vehicle.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>A waiver or inspection by a state trooper or other authorized person is required before a person may drive a commercial motor vehicle that was involved in such a collision (Minn. Stat. § 169.783).</p>

    <h3>502.7 ENFORCEMENT ACTION</h3>
    <p>After a thorough investigation in which physical evidence or independent witness statements indicate that a violation of a traffic law contributed to the collision, authorized members should issue a citation or arrest the offending driver, as appropriate.</p>
    <p>More serious violations, such as driving under the influence of drugs or alcohol, vehicular manslaughter or other felonies, shall be enforced. If a driver who is subject to enforcement action is admitted to a hospital, a supervisor shall be contacted
        to determine the best enforcement option.</p>

    <h3>502.8 REPORTS</h3>
    <p>Department members shall utilize forms approved by the Minnesota Department of Public Safety as required for the reporting of traffic collisions (Minn. Stat. § 169.09, Subd. 9). All such reports shall be forwarded to the Patrol Supervisor for approval
        and filing.</p>
    <h4>502.8.1 REPORT MODIFICATON</h4>
    <p>A change or modification of a written report that alters a material fact in the report may be made only by the member who prepared the report, and only prior to its approval and distribution. Once a report has been approved and distributed, corrections

            <div class="chapter" id="503">
	<h2>503 - Crash Review Boards</h2>
	<h2>503.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>This policy establishes a process for the Metro Transit Police Department to review vehicle crashes by its employees.</p>
    <p>The review process shall be in addition to any other review or investigation that may be conducted by any outside or multi-agency entity having jurisdiction over the investigation or evaluation of the vehicle crash.</p>

    <h3>503.2 POLICY</h3>
    <p>The Metro Transit Police Department will objectively evaluate vehicle crashes by its members to ensure that their vehicle use/operation is lawful, appropriate and consistent with training and policy.</p>

    <h3>503.3 REMOVAL FROM LINE DUTY ASSIGNMENTS</h3>
    <p>Generally, whenever an employee's actions while using department equipment, results in death or very serious injury to another, that employee will be placed in a temporary administrative assignment pending an administrative review. The Chief of Police may exercise discretion and choose not to place an employee in an administrative assignment in any case.</p>

    <h3>503.4 REVIEW BOARD</h3>
    <p>The Crash Review Board will be convened anytime a Metro Transit Police Department vehicle (owned, rented, leased etc) is involved in a crash. This includes vehicles that were being operated or parked when the crash occurred.</p>
    <p>The Chief of Police may request the Crash Review Board to investigate the circumstances surrounding any vehicle crash.</p>
    <p>The supervisor of the Crash Reconstruction Unit will convene the Crash Review Board as necessary. The involved employee's supervisor will ensure that all relevant reports, documents and materials are available for consideration and review by the board (e.g. Metro Transit Police report, DPS Motor Vehicle Crash report, crash insurance information etc).</p>
    <h4>503.4.1 COMPOSITION OF THE BOARD</h4>
    <p>The Crash Reconstruction Unit supervisor should select two Crash Review Board members from the following, as appropriate:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Metro Transit Police Department supervisor (Sergeant or Lieutenant).</li>
        <li>One full-time officer assigned to the Crash Reconstruction Unit.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>The Crash Reconstruction Unit supervisor will serve as chairperson on the three (3) person board.</p>
    <h4>503.4.2 RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE BOARD</h4>
    <p>The Crash Review Board is empowered to conduct an administrative review and inquiry into the circumstances of a vehicle crash.</p>
    <p>The Board members may request further investigation, request reports be submitted for the Board's review and call persons to present information. The Board will not request the involved employee to appear.</p>
    <p>The Board does not have the authority to recommend discipline.</p>
    <p>The Chief of Police will determine whether the Board should delay its review until after completion of any criminal investigation, review by any prosecutorial body, filing of criminal charges, the decision not to file criminal charges or any other action. The Board should be provided all relevant material from these proceedings for its consideration.</p>
    <p>The review shall be based upon those facts which were reasonably believed, known or should have been known by the officer at the time of the incident, applying any legal requirements, department policies, procedures and approved training to those facts. Facts later discovered but unknown to the officer at the time shall neither justify nor call into question an officer's decision.</p>
    <p>The Board shall make one of the following recommended findings:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The vehicle crash was preventable</li>
        <li>The vehicle crash was non-preventable</li>
    </ul>
    <p>A recommended finding requires a majority vote of the Board. The Board may also recommend additional investigations or reviews, such as training reviews to consider whether training should be developed or revised and policy reviews, as may be appropriate. The Board chairperson shall forward the necessary paperwork to the Internal Affairs Unit for processing. If the crash was determined to be preventable, the Internal Affairs Unit will then consult with the Chief of Police to determine if discipline should be considered and if so, the disciplinary process will be initiated.</p>

    <h2>510 - Vehicle Towing</h2>
    <h3>510.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>This policy provides the procedures for towing a vehicle by or at the direction of the Metro Transit Police Department and under the authority of Minn. Stat. § 168B.035.</p>

    <h3>510.2 STORAGE AND IMPOUNDS</h3>
    <p>Vehicles may be towed for violations of Minn. Stat. § 168B.035, including parking, registration and snow emergency violations.</p>
    <p>Vehicles may be moved or removed from a highway when in violation of Minn. Stat. § 169.32(a) or when left unattended upon any street or highway or upon any bridge or causeway or in any tunnel where such vehicle constitutes an obstruction to traffic
        (Minn. Stat. § 169.33).</p>
    <p>The responsibilities of those employees storing or impounding a vehicle are as follows:</p>
    <h4>510.2.1 COMPLETION OF VEHICLE IMPOUND AND INVENTORY REPORT</h4>
    <p>Department members requesting towing of a vehicle shall complete a Vehicle Impound and Inventory Report, including a description of property within the vehicle. A copy is to be given to the tow truck operator and the original is to be submitted to
        the Records Section as soon as practicable after the vehicle is stored.</p>
    <p>The Records Section shall promptly enter pertinent data from the completed Vehicle Impound and Inventory Report into the Minnesota Justice Information Services (MNJIS). In most, if not all cases, the local agency will enter the data into MNJIS.</p>
    <p>Approved Vehicle Impound and Inventory Report forms shall be promptly placed into the Records Section so that they are immediately available for release or for information, should inquiries be made.</p>
    <p>Within 48 hours, excluding weekends and holidays, of the towing of any such vehicle, it shall be the responsibility of the Records Section to determine through MNJIS the names and addresses of any individuals having an interest in the vehicle. Notice
        to all such individuals shall be sent by certified mail within five business days of impound (Minn. Stat. § 168B.06 Subd. 1). In most, if not all cases, the local agency should handle this step.</p>
    <h4>510.2.2 REMOVAL OF VEHICLE DISABLED IN A TRAFFIC COLLISION</h4>
    <p>When a vehicle has been involved in a traffic collision and must be removed from the scene, the officer shall have the driver select a towing company, if reasonably possible, and shall relay the request for the specified towing company to the dispatcher.
        When there is no preferred company requested, a company will be selected from the rotational list of towing companies maintained by the local agency.</p>
    <p>If the owner is incapacitated or for any reason it is necessary for the Department to assume responsibility for a vehicle involved in a collision, the officer shall request the dispatcher to call a company selected from the rotational list of towing
        companies. The officer will then conduct an inventory and store the vehicle using a Vehicle Impound and Inventory Report.</p>
    <h4>510.2.3 DRIVING A NON-CITY VEHICLE</h4>
    <p>Vehicles that have been towed by or at the direction of the Department should not be driven by police personnel unless it is necessary to move a vehicle a short distance to eliminate a hazard, prevent the obstruction of a fire hydrant or to comply
        with posted signs.</p>
    <h4>510.2.4 DISPATCHER'S RESPONSIBILITIES</h4>
    <p>Upon receiving a request for towing, the dispatcher shall promptly telephone the specified authorized towing service. The officer shall be advised when the request has been made and the towing service has been dispatched.</p>
    <p>When there is no preferred company requested, the dispatcher shall call the next firm in rotation from the list of approved towing companies and shall make appropriate entries on that form to ensure the next firm is called.</p>
    <h4>510.2.5 RECORDS SECTION RESPONSIBILITIES</h4>
    <p>Records Section personnel shall promptly enter pertinent data from the completed Vehicle Impound and Inventory Report form into the stolen vehicle system. Approved forms shall be promptly filed so that they are immediately available for release or
        review should inquiries be made.</p>
    <p>Within 48 hours of recovering a stolen vehicle or receiving notification that a vehicle reported stolen through this department has been recovered, the Records Section shall make a reasonable and good faith effort to notify the victim of the recovery.
        The notice must specify when the recovering law enforcement agency expects to release the vehicle to the owner and where the owner may pick up the vehicle. Upon recovery of a vehicle reported stolen to another agency, the Records Section is to
        promptly inform the agency that the vehicle is recovered, where it is located and when it can be released to the owner (Minn. Stat. § 169.042 Subd. 1).</p>
    <p>In most, if not all cases, the local agency shall make the necessary notifications.</p>

    <h3>510.3 TOWING SERVICES</h3>
    <p>Local law enforcement agencies periodically select one or more firms to act as official tow services and awards contracts to those firms. Those firms will be used in the following situations:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>When it is necessary to safeguard a vehicle due to the inability of the owner or operator to take the required action.</li>
        <li>When a vehicle is being held as evidence in connection with an investigation.</li>
        <li>When it is otherwise necessary to store a motor vehicle. This would include situations involving the recovery of stolen or abandoned vehicles and the removal of vehicles obstructing traffic in violation of state or local regulations.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If more than one firm has been awarded contracts, they shall be placed on a rotation list. Nothing in this policy shall require the Department to tow a vehicle.</p>

    <h3>510.4 TOWING AT ARREST SCENES</h3>
    <p>Whenever a person in charge or in control of a vehicle is arrested, it is the policy of this department to provide reasonable safekeeping by towing the arrestee’s vehicle subject to the exceptions described below. However, a vehicle shall be towed
        whenever it is needed for the furtherance of an investigation or prosecution of the case, or when the community caretaker doctrine would reasonably suggest that the vehicle should be towed. For example, the vehicle would present a traffic hazard
        if it were not removed, or the vehicle is located in a high-crime area and is susceptible to theft or damage if left at the scene.</p>
    <p>The following are examples of situations where consideration should be given to leaving a vehicle at the scene in lieu of towing, provided the vehicle can be lawfully parked and left in a reasonably secured and safe condition:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Traffic-related warrant arrest.</li>
        <li>Situations where the vehicle was not used to further the offense for which the occupant was arrested nor may be subject to forfeiture proceedings.</li>
        <li>Whenever the vehicle otherwise does not need to be stored and the owner requests that it be left at the scene.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In such cases, the handling employee shall note in the report that the owner was informed that the Department will not be responsible for theft or damages.</p>

    <h3>510.5 VEHICLE INVENTORY</h3>
    <p>All property in a stored or impounded vehicle shall be inventoried and listed on the vehicle storage form. This includes the trunk and any compartments or containers, even if they are closed and/or locked. Members conducting inventory searches should
        be as thorough and accurate as practicable in preparing an itemized inventory. These inventory procedures are for the purpose of protecting an owner's property while the owner is in police custody, to provide for the safety of officers and the
        public, and to protect the Department against fraudulent claims of lost, stolen or damaged property.</p>

    <h3>510.6 PRESERVATION OF EVIDENCE</h3>
    <p>An officer who removes a vehicle pursuant to Minn. Stat. § 168B.035 is required to take reasonable and necessary steps to preserve evidence. If there is probable cause to believe that a vehicle or its contents constitute any evidence which tends to
        show that a criminal offense has been committed, or that a particular person has committed a criminal offense, officers shall ensure that all legally required and reasonably necessary efforts are taken to preserve the evidence. Such evidence is
        to be provided safe storage and preserved until released to the owner or otherwise disposed of according to law.</p>

    <h3>510.7 SECURITY OF VEHICLES AND PROPERTY</h3>
    <p>Unless it would cause an unreasonable delay in the completion of a vehicle impound/storage or create an issue of officer safety, officer should make reasonable accommodations to permit a driver/owner to retrieve small items of value or personal need
        (e.g., cash, jewelry, cellular telephone, prescriptions) that are not considered evidence or contraband.</p>
    <p>If a search of a vehicle leaves the vehicle or any property contained therein vulnerable to unauthorized entry, theft or damage, personnel conducting the search shall take such steps as are reasonably necessary to secure and/or preserve the vehicle
        or property from such hazards.</p>

    <h2>512 - Vehicle Impound Hearings</h2>
    <h3>512.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>This policy establishes a procedure for the requirement to provide vehicle storage or impound hearings.</p>

    <h3>512.2 STORED OR IMPOUND HEARING</h3>
    <p>When a vehicle is stored or impounded by any member of the Metro Transit Police Department, a hearing will be conducted upon the request of the owner or operator of the vehicle to determine if probable cause existed for the removal and placement of
        the vehicle.</p>
    <p>The hearing shall be conducted within 48 hours of the request, excluding weekends and holidays. The hearing officer must be a person other than the person who directed the storage or impound of the vehicle.</p>
    <h4>512.2.1 HEARING PROCEDURES</h4>
    <p>The vehicle storage hearing is an informal process to evaluate the validity of an order to store or impound a vehicle. The employee who caused the storage or removal of the vehicle does not need to be present for this hearing.</p>
    <p>All requests for a hearing on a stored or impounded vehicle shall be submitted in person, in writing or by telephone, within 10 days of the date appearing on the notice. The Patrol Captain will generally serve as the hearing officer. The person requesting
        the hearing may record the hearing at his/her own expense.</p>
    <p>The failure of either the registered or legal owner or interested person or his/her agent to request a hearing in a timely manner or to attend a scheduled hearing shall be considered a waiver of and satisfaction of the post-storage hearing.</p>
    <p>Any relevant evidence may be submitted and reviewed by the hearing officer to determine if reasonable grounds have been established for the storage or impound of the vehicle. The initial burden of proof established by a preponderance of the evidence
        that the storage/impound was based on probable cause rests with the Department.</p>
    <p>After consideration of all information, the hearing officer shall determine the validity of the storage or impound of the vehicle in question and then render a decision. The hearing officer shall also consider any mitigating circumstances attendant
        to the storage that reasonably would warrant the release of the vehicle or a mediation or reduction of the period the vehicle is impounded.</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>If a decision is made that reasonable grounds for storage or impound have been established, the hearing officer shall advise the inquiring party of the decision that the inquiring party may pursue further civil remedies if desired.
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>If mitigating circumstances are found to be relevant, the hearing officer may make reasonable adjustments to the impound period, storage or assessment fees as warranted.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>If a decision is made that reasonable grounds for storage or impound have not been established or sufficient mitigating circumstances exist, the vehicle in storage shall be released immediately. Towing and storage fees will be at the Department's
            expense.</li>
        <li>If a decision is made that reasonable grounds for storage have not been established or sufficient mitigating circumstances exist, and the vehicle has been released with fees having been paid, the receipt for such fees will be forwarded to the
            appropriate Captain. The hearing officer will recommend to the Captain that the fees paid by the registered or legal owner of the vehicle in question or the owner's agent be reimbursed by the Department.</li>

    <h2>514 - Impaired Driving</h2>
    <h3>514.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>This policy provides guidance to those department members who play a role in the detection and investigation of driving while impaired (DWI).</p>

    <h3>514.2 POLICY</h3>
    <p>The Metro Transit Police Department is committed to the safety of the roadways and the community and will pursue fair but aggressive enforcement of Minnesota’s impaired driving laws.</p>

    <h3>514.3 INVESTIGATIONS</h3>
    <p>Officers should not enforce DWI laws to the exclusion of their other duties unless specifically assigned to DWI enforcement. All officers are expected to enforce these laws with due diligence.</p>
    <p>The Patrol Supervisor will develop and maintain, in consultation with the prosecuting attorney, report forms with appropriate checklists to assist investigating officers in documenting relevant information and maximizing efficiency. Any DWI investigation
        will be documented using these forms. Information documented elsewhere on the form does not need to be duplicated in the report narrative. Information that should be documented includes, at a minimum:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>The field sobriety tests (FSTs) administered and the results.</li>
        <li>The officer’s observations that indicate impairment on the part of the individual, and the officer’s health-related inquiries that may help to identify any serious health concerns (e.g., diabetic shock).</li>
        <li>Sources of additional information (e.g., reporting party, witnesses) and their observations.</li>
        <li>Information about any audio and/or video recording of the individual’s driving or subsequent actions.</li>
        <li>The location and time frame of the individual’s vehicle operation and how this was determined.</li>
        <li>Any prior related convictions in Minnesota or another jurisdiction.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>514.4 FIELD TESTS</h3>
    <p>The Training Coordinator should identify the primary field sobriety tests (FSTs) and any approved alternate tests for officers to use when investigating violations of DWI laws.</p>

    <h3>514.5 CHEMICAL TESTS</h3>
    <p>A person implies consent under Minnesota law to a chemical test or tests, and to providing the associated chemical sample, under any of the following (Minn. Stat. § 169A.51, Subd. 1):</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>The arresting officer has probable cause to believe the person was driving, operating or in physical control of a vehicle while impaired as defined by Minn. Stat. § 169A.20.</li>
        <li>The officer has probable cause to believe that the person is DWI and has been involved in a vehicle accident resulting in property damage, personal injury or death.</li>
        <li>The officer has probable cause to believe that the person is DWI and the person has refused to take the preliminary screening test provided for by Minn. Stat. § 169A.41.</li>
        <li>The person was administered a preliminary screening test and the results indicated an alcohol concentration of 0.08 or more.</li>
        <li>The officer has probable cause to believe the person was driving, operating or in physical control of a commercial motor vehicle with the presence of any alcohol in the person’s body.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If a person withdraws this implied consent, or is unable to withdraw consent (e.g., the person is unconscious), the officer should consider implied consent revoked and proceed as though the person has refused to provide a chemical sample.</p>
    <h4>514.5.1 BREATH SAMPLES</h4>
    <p>The Patrol Supervisor should ensure that all devices used for the collection and analysis of breath samples are properly serviced and tested, and that a record of such service and testing is properly maintained.</p>
    <p>Officers obtaining a breath sample should monitor the device for any sign of malfunction. Any anomalies or equipment failures should be noted in the appropriate report and promptly reported to the Patrol Supervisor.</p>
    <h4>514.5.2 BLOOD SAMPLES</h4>
    <p>Only persons authorized by law to draw blood shall collect blood samples (Minn. Stat. § 169A.51, Subd. 7). The blood draw should be witnessed by the assigned officer. No officer, even if properly certified, should perform this task.</p>
    <p>Officers should inform an arrestee that if he/she chooses to provide a blood sample, a separate sample can be collected for alternate testing. Unless medical personnel object, two samples should be collected and retained as evidence, so long as only
        one puncture is required.</p>
    <p>The blood sample shall be packaged, marked, handled, stored and transported as required by the testing facility.</p>
    <p>If an arrestee cannot submit to a blood test because he/she has a bleeding disorder or has taken medication that inhibits coagulation, he/she shall not be required to take a blood test. Such inability to take a blood test should not be considered
        a refusal. However, that arrestee may be required to complete another available and viable test.</p>
    <h4>514.5.3 URINE SAMPLES</h4>
    <p>If a urine test will be performed, the arrestee should be promptly transported to the appropriate testing site. The officer shall follow any directions accompanying the urine evidence collection kit.</p>
    <p>Urine samples shall be collected and witnessed by an officer or jail staff member of the same sex as the person giving the sample. The arrestee tested should be allowed sufficient privacy to maintain his/her dignity, to the extent possible, while
        still ensuring the accuracy of the sample.</p>
    <p>The sample shall be packaged, marked, handled, stored and transported as required by the testing facility.</p>
    <h4>514.5.4 STATUTORY NOTIFICATIONS</h4>
    <p>At the time that the officer requests the person to submit to a chemical test the officer must inform the person that (Minn. Stat. § 169A.51, Subd. 2):</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Minnesota law requires that he/she take the test.</li>
        <li>Refusal to take the test is a crime.</li>
        <li>If he/she was arrested for a violation of vehicular homicide and injury, the test will be taken with or without consent (Minn. Stat. § 169A.52, Subd. 1).</li>
        <li>He/she has the right to consult with an attorney unless it would unreasonably delay administration of the test.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>An officer investigating a DWI involving criminal vehicular operation is not required to make the above mentioned notice if license revocation will not be pursued.</p>

    <h3>514.6 REFUSALS</h3>
    <p>When an arrestee refuses to provide a chemical sample officers should:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Advise the arrestee of the requirement to provide a sample (Minn. Stat. § 169A.51).</li>
        <li>Audio- and/or video-record the admonishment and the response when it is legal and practicable.</li>
        <li>Document the refusal in the appropriate report.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>514.6.1 STATUTORY NOTIFICATIONS UPON REFUSAL</h4>
    <p>Upon refusal to submit to a chemical test as required by law, officers shall personally serve the notice of intention to revoke upon the person and invalidate the person’s license in such a way that no identifying information is destroyed and immediately
        return the license to the person (Minn. Stat. § 169A.52, Subd. 7).</p>
    <h4>514.6.2 BLOOD SAMPLE WITHOUT CONSENT</h4>
    <p>A blood sample may be obtained from a person who refuses a chemical test when any of the following conditions exist:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>A search warrant has been obtained.</li>
        <li>The officer can articulate that exigent circumstances exist and the officer has probable cause to believe that the person has committed vehicular homicide or injury (Minn. Stat. § 169A.52, Subd. 1). Exigency does not exist solely because of the
            short time period associated with the natural dissipation of alcohol or controlled or prohibited substances in the person’s</li>
    </ol>
    <p>bloodstream. Exigency can be established by the existence of special facts such as a lengthy delay in obtaining a blood sample due to a collision investigation or medical treatment of the person.</p>
    <h4>514.6.3 FORCED BLOOD SAMPLE</h4>
    <p>If a person indicates by word or action that he/she will physically resist a blood draw, the officer should request a supervisor to respond.</p>
    <p>The responding supervisor should:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Evaluate whether using force to obtain a blood sample is appropriate under the circumstances.</li>
        <li>Ensure that all attempts to obtain a blood sample through force cease if the person agrees to, and completes, a viable form of testing in a timely manner.</li>
        <li>Advise the person of his/her duty to provide a sample (even if this advisement was previously done by another officer), and attempt to persuade the person to submit to such a sample without physical resistance.
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>This dialogue should be recorded on audio and/or video when reasonably practicable.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Ensure that the blood sample is taken in a medically approved manner.</li>
        <li>Ensure that the forced blood draw is recorded on audio and/or video when reasonably practicable.</li>
        <li>Monitor and ensure that the type and level of force applied appears reasonable under the circumstances:
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>Unless otherwise provided in a warrant, force should generally be limited to handcuffing or similar restraint methods.</li>
                <li>In misdemeanor cases, if the arrestee becomes violent or more resistant, no additional force will be used and a refusal should be noted in the report.</li>
                <li>In felony cases, force which reasonably appears necessary to overcome the resistance to the blood draw may be permitted.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Ensure the use of force and methods used to accomplish the collection of the blood sample are documented in the related report.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>If a supervisor is unavailable, officers are expected to use sound judgment and perform the duties of a supervisor, as set forth above.</p>

    <h3>514.7 ARREST AND INVESTIGATION</h3>
    <h4>514.7.1 RIGHT TO ATTORNEY CONTACTS</h4>
    <p>A person has a limited right to consult with an attorney prior to submitting to a chemical test. This right is limited to the extent that it cannot unreasonably delay administration of the test (Minn. Stat. § 169A.51, Subd. 2).</p>
    <h4>514.7.2 ARREST AUTHORITY</h4>
    <p>An officer may arrest a person without a warrant and without regard to whether the offense was committed in the officer’s presence if there is probable cause to believe the person committed (Minn. Stat. § 169A.40):</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>A DWI offense (Minn. Stat. § 169A.20).</li>
        <li>An alcohol-related school bus or Head Start bus driving offense (Minn. Stat. § 169A.31).</li>
        <li>An underage drinking and driving offense (Minn. Stat. § 169A.33).</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>514.7.3 OFFICER_DEPUTY RESPONSIBILITIES</h4>
    <p>If an officer requests that a person submit to a chemical test and the person refuses such request, the officer shall report such refusal to the Commissioner of the Department of Public Safety (DPS) and the appropriate prosecuting attorney (Minn.
        Stat. § 169A.52, Subd. 1).</p>
    <p>If a person refuses to submit to a test or in the alternative submits to a test and the results indicate a prohibited alcohol concentration the officer shall immediately give notice to the person that his/ her driving privilege will be revoked and
        shall (Minn. Stat. § 169A.52, Subd. 7):</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Issue the person a temporary license effective for only seven days.
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>Officers are not required to issue a person a temporary license if the person’s driving privilege is under withdrawal by DPS or if the person is unlicensed.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Send the notification of this action to the Commissioner of the DPS along with the certification that there was probable cause to believe the person had been driving, operating or in physical control of a motor vehicle while impaired, and that
            the person either refused to submit to a test or submitted to a test and the results indicated a prohibited alcohol concentration or drug presence.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Test results of a person that indicated a prohibited alcohol concentration or drug presence shall be forwarded to the Commissioner of the DPS and the appropriate prosecuting attorney (Minn. Stat. § 169A.52, Subd. 2).</p>
    <h4>514.7.4 PRELIMINARY SCREENING TEST</h4>
    <p>An officer who has reason to believe the person was driving, operating or in physical control of a motor vehicle while impaired, may require the person to provide a sample of the person’s breath for a preliminary screening test using a device approved
        by the DPS Commissioner (Minn. Stat. § 169A.41, Subd. 1).</p>
    <p>The officer must use the results of the preliminary screening test for the purpose of deciding whether to arrest the person and require further chemical testing pursuant to Minn. Stat. § 169A.51 (Minn. Stat. § 169A.41, Subd. 2).</p>
    <h4>514.7.5 DESIGNATION OF TESTS</h4>
    <p>The officer who requires a test of a person suspected of DWI may direct whether the test is of blood, breath or urine (Minn. Stat. § 169A.51, Subd. 3). Action may be taken against a person who refuses to take a blood or urine test only if an alternative
        test was offered (Minn. Stat. § 169A.51, Subd. 3).</p>
    <p>In addition a blood or urine test may be required subsequent to an administered breath test if the officer has probable cause to believe that (Minn. Stat. § 169A.51, Subd. 4):</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>The person’s impairment is due to a controlled substance or a hazardous substance that is not subject to testing by a breath test.</li>
        <li>A controlled substance listed in Schedule I or II or its metabolite (other than marijuana or tetrahydrocannabinols), is present in the person’s body.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Action may be taken against a person refusing to submit to a blood or urine test under the aforementioned circumstances only if an alternative test of blood or urine, as applicable, was offered.</p>
    <h4>514.7.6 ADDITIONAL TESTING</h4>
    <p>An officer shall permit a person required to submit to a chemical test to have a qualified person of his/her own choosing administer a separate chemical test (Minn. Stat. § 169A.51, Subd. 7(b)). The separate chemical test shall:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Be conducted at the place where the person is in custody.</li>
        <li>Be conducted after the officer has administered the statutorily mandated test.</li>
        <li>Impose no expense to the state.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>514.7.7 ADDITIONAL REQUIREMENTS FOR BREATH SAMPLES</h4>

											                <p>Employees of this department do not have the authority to dismiss a citation once it has been issued. Only the court has the authority to dismiss a citation that has been issued. Any request from a recipient to dismiss a citation shall be referred to the Shift Supervisor. Upon a review of the circumstances involving the issuance of the traffic citation, the Shift Supervisor may request the Patrol Captain to recommend dismissal of the traffic citation. If approved, the citation will be forwarded to the appropriate prosecutor with a request for dismissal. All recipients of traffic citations whose request for dismissal of a traffic citation has been denied shall be referred to the appropriate court.</p>
											                <p>Should an officer determine during a court proceeding that a traffic citation should be dismissed in the interest of justice or where prosecution is deemed inappropriate, the officer may request the prosecutor to dismiss the citation. Upon dismissal of the traffic citation by the court, the officer shall notify his/her immediate supervisor of the circumstances surrounding the dismissal and shall complete any paperwork as directed or required.

									                        <h4>516.7.1 APPEAL STAGES</h4>
    <p>Appeals may be pursued sequentially at three different levels:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Administrative reviews are conducted by the Patrol Captain, which will review written/ documentary data. Requests for administrative reviews may be made at the Metro Transit Police Department. These requests are informal written statements outlining
            why the notice of parking violation should be dismissed. Copies of documentation relating to the notice of parking violation and the request for dismissal must be mailed to the current mailing address of the processing agency.</li>
        <li>If the appellant wishes to pursue the matter beyond administrative review, an administrative hearing may be conducted in person or by written application, at the election of the appellant. Independent referees review the existent administrative
            file, amendments and/or testimonial material provided by the appellant and may conduct further investigation or follow-up on their own.</p>
        </li>
        <li>If the appellant wishes to pursue the matter beyond an administrative hearing, an appellant may petition a municipal court for a hearing by filing with the clerk of the municipal court and posting fees as required.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>516.7.2 TIME REQUIREMENTS</h4>
    <p>Administrative review or appearance before a hearing examiner will not be provided if the mandated time limits are not adhered to by the violator.</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Requests for an administrative review must be postmarked within 21 days of issuance of the notice of parking violation, or within 10 days of mailing the Notice of Delinquent Parking Violation.</li>
        <li>Requests for administrative hearings must be postmarked within 15 days of the notification mailing of the results of the administrative review.</li>
        <li>Requests for appeal to the District Court must be made within 20 days of the mailing of the administrative hearing results.</li>
        <li>Registered owners of leased or rented vehicles may transfer responsibility for the violation to the lessee or renter of the vehicle at the time of the violation if the name, address and driver's license number of the lessee/renter is provided
            to the processing agency within 30 days of the mail date of the delinquent notice.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>516.7.3 COSTS</h4>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>There is no cost for an administrative review.</li>
        <li>Appellants must pay the full amount due for the citation or provide satisfactory proof of their inability to pay, before receiving an administrative hearing.</li>
        <li>An appeal through District Court requires prior payment of filing costs including applicable court charges and fees. These costs will be reimbursed to the appellant in addition to any previously paid fines if appellant's liability is overruled
            by the District Court.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>516.8 JUVENILE CITATIONS</h3>
    <p>Completion of traffic citation forms for juveniles may vary slightly from the procedure for adults. The juvenile’s age, place of residency and the type of offense should be considered before issuing the juvenile a citation.</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>When any juvenile is issued a citation for a drug or alcohol violation, or a juvenile 16 years of age or older is issued a citation for an adult court traffic offense, the officer shall follow the arrest procedures prescribed in Minn. Stat. §
            169.91 and shall make reasonable effort to notify the child's parent or guardian of the violation and the nature of the charge. Notifications should be documented (Minn. Stat. § 260B.225 Subd. 3).</li>
        <li>When any juvenile is issued a citation for a major traffic offense, the officer is required to file a signed copy of the citation, as provided in Minn. Stat. § 169.91, with the juvenile court</li>
    </ol>
    <p>of the county in which the violation occurred. The citation serves as a petition providing the juvenile court jurisdiction (Minn. Stat. § 260B.225 Subd. 5).</p>

    <h2>520 - Disabled Vehicles</h2>
    <h3>520.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>Law enforcement and other public agencies may develop and adopt a written policy to provide assistance to motorists in disabled vehicles within their primary jurisdiction.</p>

    <h3>520.2 OFFICER RESPONSIBILITIES</h3>
    <p>When an on-duty officer observes a disabled vehicle on the roadway, the officer should make a reasonable effort to provide assistance. If that officer is assigned to a call of higher priority, the dispatcher should be advised of the location of the
        disabled vehicle and the need for assistance. The dispatcher should then assign another available officer to respond for assistance as soon as practicable.</p>

    <h3>520.3 EXTENT OF ASSISTANCE</h3>
    <p>In most cases, a disabled motorist will require assistance. After arrangements for assistance are made, continued involvement by Department personnel will be contingent on the time of day, the location, the availability of Department resources and
        the vulnerability of the disabled motorist.</p>
    <h4>520.3.1 MECHANICAL REPAIRS</h4>
    <p>Department personnel shall not make mechanical repairs to a disabled vehicle. The use of push bumpers to relocate vehicles to a position of safety is not considered a mechanical repair.</p>
    <h4>520.3.2 RELOCATION OF DISABLED VEHICLES</h4>
    <p>The relocation of disabled vehicles by members of this department by pushing or pulling a vehicle should only occur when the conditions reasonably indicate that immediate movement is necessary to reduce a hazard presented by the disabled vehicle.</p>

            from the property (Minn. Stat. § 168B.04 Subd. 2 (b) (2)).</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>524.2 MARKING VEHICLES</h3>
    <p>Vehicles on public roadways suspected of being abandoned in violation of Minnesota abandoned vehicle laws shall be marked and noted on the officers log. Officers shall also make notification to TCC. No case number is required at this time.</p>
    <p>A visible chalk, crayon or paint mark should be placed on the rear window or left rear tire tread at the fender level unless the vehicle is missing tires or other vehicle conditions or weather prevent marking.</p>
    <p>If a marked vehicle has been moved or the markings have been removed during a four or 24-hour investigation period, the vehicle shall be marked again for either the four or 24-hour abandonment violation and the above process repeated.</p>
    <h4>524.2.1 MARKED VEHICLE FILE</h4>
    <p>TCC shall be responsible for maintaining a file for or notifying the local jurisdiction on all marked vehicles.</p>
    <h4>524.2.2 VEHICLE STORAGE</h4>
    <p>Any vehicle in violation shall be stored by the authorized towing service and a vehicle storage report shall be completed by the officer authorizing the storage of the vehicle.</p>
    <p>The storage report form shall be submitted to the Records Section immediately following the storage of the vehicle. It shall be the responsibility of the Records Section to immediately notify the Minnesota Criminal Justice Information Services (MNJIS).
        Notification may also be made to the National Law Enforcement Telecommunications System (NLETS).</p>
    <p>Within 48 hours of the storage of any such vehicle, excluding weekends and holidays, it shall be the responsibility of the Records Section to immediately notify MNJIS. Notification may also be made to the NLETS. In most, if not all cases, the local
        agency shall make the notification.</p>

    <h2>600 -  Investigation and Prosecution</h2>
    <h3>600.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this policy is to set guidelines and requirements pertaining to the handling and disposition of criminal investigations.</p>

    <h3>600.2 POLICY</h3>
    <p>It is the policy of the Metro Transit Police Department to investigate crimes thoroughly and with due diligence, and to evaluate and prepare criminal cases for appropriate clearance or submission to a prosecutor.</p>

    <h3>600.3 INITIAL INVESTIGATION</h3>
    <h4>600.3.1 OFFICER RESPONSIBILITIES</h4>
    <p>An officer responsible for an initial investigation shall complete no less than the following:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Make a preliminary determination of whether a crime has been committed by completing, at a minimum:
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>An initial statement from any witnesses or complainants.</li>
                <li>A cursory examination for evidence.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>If information indicates a crime has occurred, the officer shall:
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>Preserve the scene and any evidence as required to complete the initial and follow- up investigation.</li>
                <li>Determine if additional investigative resources (e.g., investigators or scene processing) are necessary and request assistance as required.</li>
                <li>If assistance is warranted, or if the incident is not routine, notify a supervisor or the Shift Supervisor.</li>
                <li>Make reasonable attempts to locate, identify and interview all available victims, complainants, witnesses and suspects.</li>
                <li>Collect any evidence.</li>
                <li>Take any appropriate law enforcement action.</li>
                <li>Complete and submit the appropriate reports and documentation.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>If the preliminary determination is that no crime occurred, determine what other action may be necessary, what other resources may be available, and advise the informant or complainant of this information.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>600.3.2 NON-LICENSED MEMBER RESPONSIBILITIES</h4>
    <p>A non-licensed member assigned to any preliminary investigation is responsible for all investigative steps, except making any attempt to locate, contact or interview a suspect face-to-face or take any enforcement action. Should an initial investigation
        indicate that those steps are required, the assistance of an officer shall be requested.</p>

    <h3>600.4 CUSTODIAL INTERROGATION REQUIREMENTS</h3>
    <p>Suspects who are in custody and subjected to an interrogation shall be given the <em>Miranda </em>warning, unless an exception applies. Interview or interrogation of a juvenile shall be in accordance with the Temporary Custody of Juveniles Policy.</p>
    <h4>600.4.1 AUDIO/VIDEO RECORDINGS</h4>
    <p>Any custodial interrogation of a person who is suspected of having committed a criminal offense should be electronically recorded (audio/video or both as available) in its entirety, including any information or discussion about the person’s rights
        and any waiver of those rights. Regardless of where the interrogation occurs, every reasonable effort should be made to secure functional recording equipment to accomplish such recordings.</p>
    <p>Consideration should also be given to recording a non-custodial interrogation, or any investigative interview, for any other offense when it is reasonable to believe it would be appropriate and beneficial to the investigation and is otherwise allowed
        by law.</p>
    <p>No recording of a custodial interrogation should be destroyed or altered without written authorization from the prosecuting attorney and the Investigation Division supervisor. Copies of recorded interrogations or interviews may be made in the same
        or a different format as the original recording, provided the copies are true, accurate and complete and are made only for authorized and legitimate law enforcement purposes.</p>
    <p>Recordings should not take the place of a thorough report and investigative interviews. Written statements from suspects should continue to be obtained when applicable.</p>

    <h3>600.5 DISCONTINUATION OF INVESTIGATIONS</h3>
    <p>The investigation of a criminal case or efforts to seek prosecution should only be discontinued if one of the following applies:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>All reasonable investigative efforts have been exhausted, no reasonable belief that the person who committed the crime can be identified, and the incident has been documented appropriately.</li>
        <li>The perpetrator of a misdemeanor has been identified and a warning is the most appropriate disposition.
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>In these cases, the investigator shall document that the person was warned and why prosecution was not sought.</li>
                <li>Warnings shall not be given for felony offenses or other offenses identified in this policy or by law that require an arrest or submission of a case to a prosecutor.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>The case has been submitted to the appropriate prosecutor but no charges have been filed. Further investigation is not reasonable nor has the prosecutor requested further investigation.</li>
        <li>The case has been submitted to the appropriate prosecutor, charges have been filed, and further investigation is not reasonable, warranted or requested, and there is no need to take the suspect into custody.</li>
        <li>Suspects have been arrested, there are no other suspects, and further investigation is either not warranted or requested.</li>
        <li>Investigation has proven that a crime was not committed (see the Sexual Assault Investigations Policy for special considerations in these cases).</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The Domestic Abuse, Child Abuse, Sexual Assault Investigations and Adult Abuse policies may also require an arrest or submittal of a case to a prosecutor.</p>

    <h3>600.6 COMPUTERS AND DIGITAL EVIDENCE</h3>
    <p>The collection, preservation, transportation and storage of computers, cell phones and other digital devices may require specialized handling to preserve the value of the related evidence. If it is anticipated that computers or similar equipment will
        be seized, officers should request that computer forensic examiners assist with seizing computers and related evidence. If a forensic examiner is unavailable, officers should take reasonable steps to prepare for such seizure and use the resources
        that are available.</p>

    <h3>600.7 INVESTIGATIVE USE OF SOCIAL MEDIA AND INTERNET SOURCES</h3>
    <p>Use of social media and any other Internet source to access information for the purpose of criminal investigation shall comply with applicable laws and policies regarding privacy, civil rights and civil liberties. Information gathered via the Internet
        should only be accessed by members while on-duty and for purposes related to the mission of this department. If a member encounters information relevant to a criminal investigation while off-duty or while using his/her own equipment, the member
        should note the dates, times and locations of the information and report the discovery to his/her supervisor as soon as practicable. The member, or others who have been assigned to do so, should attempt to replicate the finding when on-duty and
        using department equipment.</p>
    <p>Information obtained via the Internet should not be archived or stored in any manner other than department-established record keeping systems (see the Records Maintenance and Release and Criminal Organizations policies).</p>
    <h4>600.7.1 ACCESS RESTRICTIONS</h4>
    <p>Information that can be accessed from any department computer, without the need of an account, password, email address, alias or other identifier (unrestricted websites), may be accessed and used for legitimate investigative purposes without supervisory
        approval.</p>
    <p>Accessing information from any Internet source that requires the use or creation of an account, password, email address, alias or other identifier, or the use of nongovernment IP addresses, requires supervisor approval prior to access. The supervisor
        will review the justification for accessing the information and consult with legal counsel as necessary to identify any policy or legal restrictions. Any such access and the supervisor approval shall be documented in the related investigative
        report.</p>
    <p>Accessing information that requires the use of a third party’s account or online identifier requires supervisor approval and the consent of the third party. The consent must be voluntary and shall be documented in the related investigative report.</p>
    <p>Information gathered from any Internet source should be evaluated for its validity, authenticity, accuracy and reliability. Corroborative evidence should be sought and documented in the related investigative report.</p>
    <p>Any information collected in furtherance of an investigation through an Internet source should be documented in the related report. Documentation should include the source of information and the dates and times that the information was gathered.</p>
    <h4>600.7.2 INTERCEPTING ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATION</h4>
    <p>Intercepting social media communications in real time may be subject to federal and state wiretap laws. Officers should seek legal counsel before any such interception.</p>

    <h3>600.8 ELECTRONIC BENEFIT TRANSFER (EBT) CARDS</h3>
    <p>Officers shall make a report any time they arrest a person who possesses more than one welfare Electronic Benefit Transfer (EBT) card. The investigating officers shall forward this report to the Minnesota Department of Human Services within 30 days
        of the arrest. The report shall include all of the following (Minn. Stat. § 626.5533):</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>The name, address and driver’s license or state identification card number of the suspect</li>
        <li>The number on each EBT card and name, if any</li>
        <li>The date and location of any alleged offense</li>
        <li>Any other information the Minnesota Department of Human Services may require on related state forms</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>600.9 LOCAL AGENCY NOTIFICATION</h3>
    <p>It is the responsibility of this Department to notify the law enforcement agency with primary jurisdiction when surveillance or an investigation has been initiated on any person within the jurisdiction of that agency (Minn. Stat. § 473.407 Subd. 3).
        Notification to the law enforcement agency should be accomplished in one of the following manners:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Manual completion of the local agency police report.</li>
        <li>Automatic or automated population of the local agency police report (data transfer).</li>
        <li>Providing a copy of the Metro Transit Police report to the local agency.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>600.10 MODIFICATION OF CHARGES FILED</h3>
    <p>Members are not authorized to recommend to the prosecutor or to any other official of the court that charges on a pending case be amended or dismissed without the authorization of a Captain, Deputy Chief or the Chief of Police. Any authorized request
        to modify the charges or to recommend dismissal of charges shall be made to the prosecutor.</p>
</div>
            <div class="chapter" id="602">
    <h2>602 - Sexual Assault Investigations</h2>
    <h3>602.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this policy is to establish guidelines for the investigation of sexual assaults. These guidelines will address some of the unique aspects of such cases and the effects that these crimes have on the victims.</p>
    <p>Mandatory notifications requirements are addressed in the Child Abuse and Adult Abuse policies.</p>
    <h4>602.1.1 DEFINITIONS</h4>
    <p>Definitions related to this policy include:</p>
    <p><strong>Sexual assault</strong> - Any crime or attempted crime of a sexual nature, to include, but not limited to, offenses defined in Minn. Stat § 609.293 and Minn. Stat. § 609.342 through Minn. Stat. § 609. 3453.</p>
    <p><strong>Sexual Assault Response Team (SART)</strong> - A multidisciplinary team generally comprised of advocates, law enforcement officers, forensic medical examiners, including sexual assault nurse examiners (SANEs) if possible, forensic laboratory
        personnel and prosecutors. The team is designed to coordinate a broad response to sexual assault victims.</p>

    <h3>602.2 POLICY</h3>
    <p>It is the policy of the Metro Transit Police Department that its members, when responding to reports of sexual assaults, will strive to minimize the trauma experienced by the victims, and will aggressively investigate sexual assaults, pursue expeditious
        apprehension and conviction of perpetrators, and protect the safety of the victims and the community.</p>

    <h3>602.3 QUALIFIED INVESTIGATORS</h3>
    <p>Qualified investigators should be available for assignment of sexual assault investigations. These investigators should:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Have specialized training in, and be familiar with, interview techniques and the medical and legal issues that are specific to sexual assault investigations.</li>
        <li>Conduct follow-up interviews and investigation.</li>
        <li>Present appropriate cases of alleged sexual assault to the prosecutor for review.</li>
        <li>Coordinate with other enforcement agencies, social service agencies and medical personnel as needed.</li>
        <li>Provide referrals to therapy services, victim advocates and support for the victim.</li>
        <li>Participate in or coordinate with SART or other multidisciplinary investigative teams as applicable.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>602.4 INVESTIGATION AND REPORTING</h3>
    <p>In all reported or suspected cases of sexual assault, a report should be written and assigned for follow-up investigation. This includes incidents in which the allegations appear unfounded or unsubstantiated.</p>
    <h4>602.4.1 VICTIM INTERVIEWS</h4>
    <p>The primary considerations in sexual assault investigations, which begin with the initial call to Transit Control Center, should be the health and safety of the victim, the preservation of evidence, and preliminary interviews to determine if a crime
        has been committed and to attempt to identify the suspect.</p>
    <p>Whenever possible, a member of SART should be included in the initial victim interviews.</p>
    <p>An in-depth follow-up interview should not be conducted until after the medical and forensic examinations are completed and the personal needs of the victim have been met (e.g., change of clothes, bathing). The follow-up interview may be delayed to
        the following day based upon the circumstances. Whenever practicable, the follow-up interview should be conducted by a qualified investigator.</p>
    <p>Victims are often reluctant or embarrassed to discuss details. Recanting or changing one or more aspects of a prior statement is not necessarily an indication of false reporting or that the case is unfounded. If the responding officer has reason to
        believe the incident may be without merit, he/ she should document the evidence and inconsistencies. Due to physical and emotional trauma, and the myths and stereotypes associated with sexual assault, inconsistencies in the victim's report are
        not uncommon. No opinions of whether the case is unfounded shall be included in the report.</p>
    <h3>602.4.2 VICTIM CONFIDENTIALITY</h3>
    <p>Officers investigating or receiving a report of an alleged sex offense shall assist in keeping the identity of the victim private by providing the victim with Safe at Home Program information. A notation should be made within the incident report that
        the Safe at Home Program information was provided to the victim.</p>
    <p>The Department shall withhold public access to information that would reveal the identity of a victim or alleged victim of criminal sexual conduct or sex trafficking (Minn. Stat. § 13.82, Subd. 17(b); Minn. Stat. § 611A.021).</p>
    <h3>602.4.3 POLYGRAPH EXAMINATION</h3>
    <p>An officer shall not require a sexual assault victim to submit to a polygraph examination as a condition to investigating, charging or prosecuting the offense (Minn. Stat. § 611A.26, Subd. 1; Minn. Stat. § 611A.26, Subd. 5).</p>
    <p>Officers may conduct a polygraph examination of a sexual assault victim only at the victim's request and with written, informed consent after the victim has been referred to and had the opportunity to exercise the option of consulting with a sexual
        assault counselor (Minn. Stat. § 611A.26, Subd. 2 and Minn. Stat. § 611A.26, Subd. 3).</p>
    <p>To consent to a polygraph, the officer must inform the victim in writing that (Minn. Stat. § 611A.26, Subd. 4):</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>The taking of a polygraph is voluntary and solely at the victim’s request.</li>
        <li>The victim may not be asked or required to submit to a polygraph examination.</li>
        <li>The results of the examination are not admissible in court.</li>
        <li>The victim’s refusal to submit to a polygraph examination may not be used as a basis not to investigate, charge or prosecute the offender.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>602.4.4 COLLECTION AND TESTING OF BIOLOGICAL EVIDENCE</h4>
    <p>Whenever possible, a SART member should be involved in the collection of forensic evidence from the victim.</p>
    <p>When the facts of the case indicate that collection of biological evidence is warranted, it should be collected regardless of how much time has elapsed since the reported assault.</p>
    <p>If a drug-facilitated sexual assault is suspected, it is critical to the investigation that a urine sample from the victim be collected by a medical professional.</p>
    <p>If resources allow, kits or biological evidence from all rape cases, including cases where the suspect is known by the victim, should be submitted for biological testing. The result and the case information should be entered into state and national registries in a timely manner.</p>
    <p>All evidence from cases where the suspect is a stranger to the victim shall be transmitted in a timely manner to the proper forensics lab for processing all relevant biological evidence.</p>
    <h4>602.4.5 DISPOSITION OF CASES</h4>
    <p>If the assigned investigator has reason to believe the case is without merit, the case may be classified as unfounded only upon review and approval of the Investigation Division supervisor.</p>
    <p>Classification of a rape case as unfounded requires the Investigation Division supervisor to determine that the facts have significant irregularities with reported information and that the incident could not have happened as it was reported. When a victim has recanted his/her original statement, there must be corroborating evidence to support the recanted information before the case should be determined as unfounded.</p>
    <h4>602.4.6 AUDITING CASE DISPOSITIONS</h4>
	<p>The Investigation Division supervisor will ensure case dispositions are reviewed on a periodic basis using an identified group that is independent of the investigation process. The SART and/ or victim advocates should be considered for involvement in this audit.</p>

    <h3>602.5 RELEASING INFORMATION TO THE PUBLIC</h3>
    <p>In cases where the perpetrator is not known to the victim, and especially if there are multiple crimes where more than one appear to be related, consideration should be given to releasing information to the public whenever there is a reasonable likelihood
        that doing so may result in developing helpful investigative leads. The Investigation Division supervisor should weigh the risk of alerting the suspect to the investigation with the need to protect the victim and the public, and to prevent more
        crimes.
    </p>

    <h3>602.6 TRAINING</h3>
    <p>Subject to available resources, periodic training will be provided to:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Members who are first responders. This includes, but is not limited to, the following topics:
            <ol class="decimal">

                <li>Legal issues</li>
                <li>Victim advocacy</li>
                <li>Victim’s response to trauma</li>

        </li>
        <li>Qualified investigators who should receive advanced training on additional topics. This includes, but is not limited to, the following:
            <ol class="decimal">

    <h3>606.5 PROCESSING SEIZED PROPERTY FOR FORFEITURE PROCEEDINGS</h3>
    <p>When property or cash subject to this policy is seized, the officer making the seizure should ensure compliance with the following:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>If the retail value of the asset to be seized is $50,000 or less, completely and accurately prepare the Notice of Seizure and Intent to Forfeit Property Form (seizure form) and present it to the person from whom the property is to be seized for
            that person’s signature. If the person refuses to sign, the officer shall indicate on the seizure form that the person refused. The seizure form is not used when the value of the seized property exceeds $50,000.</li>
        <li>Prepare and provide a receipt for the items seized to the person from whom the property is being seized.
            <ol class="decimal">

        <li>When property is seized and no one claims possession of the property, the officer must leave a receipt in the place where the property was found if it is reasonably possible to do so.</li>
        <li>The officer will book seized property into the Property and Evidence as evidence, with the notation in the comment section of the property form, "Seized Subject to Forfeiture." Property seized subject to forfeiture should be booked on a separate

    <h2>608 - Informants</h2>
    <h3>608.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this policy is to provide guidelines for the use of informants.</p>
    <h4>608.1.1 DEFINITIONS</h4>
    <p>Definitions related to this policy include:</p>
    <p><strong>Informant</strong> - A person who covertly interacts with other individuals or suspects at the direction of, request of, or by agreement with the Metro Transit Police Department for law enforcement purposes. This also includes a person agreeing
        to supply information to the Metro Transit Police Department for a benefit (e.g., a quid pro quo in the form of a reduced criminal penalty, money).</p>

    <h3>608.2 POLICY</h3>
    <p>The Metro Transit Police Department recognizes the value of informants to law enforcement efforts and will strive to protect the integrity of the informant process. It is the policy of this department that all funds related to informant payments will
        be routinely audited and that payments to informants will be made according to the criteria outlined in this policy.</p>

    <h3>608.3 USE OF INFORMANTS</h3>
    <h4>608.3.1 INITIAL APPROVAL</h4>
    <p>Before using an individual as an informant, an officer must receive approval from his/her supervisor and the Investigation Division supervisor. The officer shall compile sufficient information through a background investigation and experience with
        the informant in order to determine the suitability of the individual, including age, maturity and risk of physical harm, as well as any indicators of his/her reliability and credibility.</p>
    <p>Members of this department should not guarantee absolute safety or confidentiality to an informant.</p>
    <h4>608.3.2 JUVENILE INFORMANTS</h4>
    <p>The use of informants under the age of 13 is prohibited.</p>
    <p>In all cases, a juvenile 13 years of age or older may only be used as an informant with the written consent of each of the following:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>The juvenile’s parents or legal guardians</li>
        <li>The juvenile’s attorney, if any</li>
        <li>The court in which the juvenile’s case is being handled, if applicable</li>
        <li>The Chief of Police or the authorized designee</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>608.3.3 INFORMANT AGREEMENTS</h4>
    <p>All informants are required to sign and abide by the provisions of the designated department informant agreement. The officer using the informant shall discuss each of the provisions of the agreement with the informant.</p>
    <p>Details of the agreement are to be approved in writing by the Investigation Division supervisor before being finalized with the informant.</p>

    <h3>608.4 INFORMANT INTEGRITY</h3>
    <p>To maintain the integrity of the informant process, the following must be adhered to:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>The identity of an informant acting in a confidential capacity shall not be withheld from the Chief of Police, Captain, Investigation Division supervisor or their authorized designees.
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>Identities of informants acting in a confidential capacity shall otherwise be kept confidential.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Criminal activity by informants shall not be condoned.</li>
        <li>Informants shall be told they are not acting as police officers, employees or agents of the Metro Transit Police Department, and that they shall not represent themselves as such.</li>
        <li>The relationship between department members and informants shall always be ethical and professional.
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>Members shall not become intimately involved with an informant.</li>
                <li>Social contact shall be avoided unless it is necessary to conduct an official investigation, and only with prior approval of the Investigation Division supervisor.</li>
                <li>Members shall neither solicit nor accept gratuities or engage in any private business transaction with an informant.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Officers shall not meet with informants in a private place unless accompanied by at least one additional officer or with prior approval of the Investigation Division supervisor.
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>Officers may meet informants alone in an occupied public place, such as a restaurant.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>When contacting informants for the purpose of making payments, officers shall arrange for the presence of another officer.</li>
        <li>In all instances when department funds are paid to informants, a voucher shall be completed in advance, itemizing the expenses.</li>
        <li>Since the decision rests with the appropriate prosecutor, officers shall not promise that the informant will receive any form of leniency or immunity from criminal prosecution.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>608.4.1 UNSUITABLE INFORMANTS</h4>
    <p>The suitability of any informant should be considered before engaging him/her in any way in a covert or other investigative process. Members who become aware that an informant may be unsuitable will notify the supervisor, who will initiate a review
        to determine suitability. Until a determination has been made by a supervisor, the informant should not be used by any member. The supervisor shall determine whether the informant should be used by the Department and,</p>
    <p>if so, what conditions will be placed on his/her participation or any information the informant provides. The supervisor shall document the decision and conditions in file notes and mark the file “unsuitable” when appropriate.</p>
    <p>Considerations for determining whether an informant is unsuitable include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>The informant has provided untruthful or unreliable information in the past.</li>
        <li>The informant behaves in a way that may endanger the safety of an officer.</li>
        <li>The informant reveals to suspects the identity of an officer or the existence of an investigation.</li>
        <li>The informant appears to be using his/her affiliation with this department to further criminal objectives.</li>
        <li>The informant creates officer-safety issues by providing information to multiple law enforcement agencies simultaneously, without prior notification and approval of each agency.</li>
        <li>The informant engages in any other behavior that could jeopardize the safety of officers or the integrity of a criminal investigation.</li>
        <li>The informant commits criminal acts subsequent to entering into an informant agreement.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>608.5 INFORMANT FILES</h3>
    <p>Informant files shall be utilized as a source of background information about the informant, to enable review and evaluation of information provided by the informant, and to minimize incidents that could be used to question the integrity of department
        members or the reliability of the informant.</p>
    <p>Informant files shall be maintained in a secure area within the Investigation Division. The Investigation Division supervisor or the authorized designee shall be responsible for maintaining informant files. Access to the informant files shall be restricted
        to the Chief of Police, Captain, Investigation Division supervisor or their authorized designees.</p>
    <p>The Criminal Investigations Supervisor should arrange for an audit using a representative sample of randomly selected informant files on a periodic basis, but no less than one time per year. If the Investigation Division supervisor is replaced, the
        files will be audited before the new supervisor takes over management of the files. The purpose of the audit is to ensure compliance with file content and updating provisions of this policy. The audit should be conducted by a supervisor who does
        not have normal access to the informant files.</p>
    <h4>608.5.1 FILE SYSTEM PROCEDURE</h4>
    <p>A separate file shall be maintained on each informant and shall be coded with an assigned informant control number. An informant history that includes the following information shall be prepared for each file:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Name and aliases</li>
        <li>Date of birth</li>
        <li>Physical description: sex, race, height, weight, hair color, eye color, scars, tattoos or other distinguishing features</li>

        <li>Current home address and telephone numbers</li>
        <li>Current employers, positions, addresses and telephone numbers</li>
        <li>Vehicles owned and registration information</li>
        <li>Places frequented</li>
        <li>Briefs of information provided by the informant and his/her subsequent reliability</p>
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>If an informant is determined to be unsuitable, the informant's file is to be marked "unsuitable" and notations included detailing the issues that caused this classification.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Name of the officer initiating use of the informant</li>
        <li>Signed informant agreement</li>
        <li>Update on active or inactive status of informant</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>608.6 INFORMANT PAYMENTS</h3>
    <p>No informant will be told in advance or given an exact amount or percentage for his/her service. The amount of funds to be paid to any informant will be evaluated against the following criteria:</p>
    <ul>

    <h4>608.6.1 PAYMENT PROCESS</h4>
    <p>Approved payments to an informant should be in cash using the following process:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Payments of $500 and under may be paid in cash from a Investigation Division buy/expense fund.
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>The Investigation Division supervisor shall sign the voucher for cash payouts from the buy/expense fund.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Payments exceeding $500 shall be made by issuance of a check, payable to the officer who will be delivering the payment.</p>

                <li>The cash transfer form shall include the following:
                    <ol class="alpha">
                        <li>Date</li>
                        <li>Payment amount</li>
                        <li>Metro Transit Police Department case number</li>
                        <li>A statement that the informant is receiving funds in payment for information voluntarily rendered.</li>
                    </ol>
                </li>
                <li>The cash transfer form shall be signed by the informant.</li>

        </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>608.6.2 REPORTING OF PAYMENTS</h4>
    <p>Each informant receiving a cash payment shall be advised of his/her responsibility to report the cash to the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) as income. If funds distributed exceed $600 in any reporting year, the informant should be provided IRS Form

        not be issued.</p>
    <p>In such cases, the informant shall be provided a letter identifying the amount he/she must report on a tax return as “other income” and shall be required to provide a signed acknowledgement of receipt of the letter. The completed acknowledgement form
        and a copy of the letter shall be retained in the informant’s file.</p>
    <h4>608.6.3 AUDIT OF PAYMENTS</h4>
    <p>The Investigation Division supervisor or the authorized designee shall be responsible for compliance with any audit requirements associated with grant provisions and applicable state and federal law.</p>
    <p>At least once every six months, the Chief of Police or the authorized designee should conduct an audit of all informant funds for the purpose of accountability and security of the funds. The funds and related documents (e.g., buy/expense fund records,
        cash transfer forms, invoices, receipts and logs) will assist with the audit process.</p>

    <h3>610.3 INTERPRETIVE SERVICES</h3>
    <p>Officers should make a reasonable effort to arrange for an interpreter before proceeding with eyewitness identification if communication with a witness is impeded due to language or hearing barriers.</p>
    <p>Before the interpreter is permitted to discuss any matter with the witness, the investigating officer should explain the identification process to the interpreter. Once it is determined that the interpreter comprehends the process and can explain
        it to the witness, the eyewitness identification may proceed as provided for within this policy.</p>

    <h3>610.4 EYEWITNESS IDENTIFICATION FORM</h3>
    <p>The Investigation Division supervisor shall be responsible for the development and maintenance of an eyewitness identification process for use by members when they are conducting eyewitness identifications.</p>
    <p>The process and any related forms or reports should provide:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>The date, time and location of the eyewitness identification procedure.</li>
        <li>The name and identifying information of the witness.</li>
        <li>The name of the person administering the identification procedure.</li>
        <li>If applicable, the names of all of the individuals present during the identification procedure.</li>
        <li>An admonishment that the suspect’s photograph may or may not be among those presented and that the witness is not obligated to make an identification.</li>
        <li>An admonishment to the witness that the investigation will continue regardless of whether an identification is made by the witness.</li>
        <li>A signature line where the witness acknowledges that he/she understands the identification procedures and instructions.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The process and related forms should be reviewed at least annually and modified when necessary.</p>

    <h3>610.5 EYEWITNESS IDENTIFICATION</h3>
    <p>Officers are cautioned not to, in any way, influence a witness as to whether any subject or photo presented in a lineup is in any way connected to the case. Officers should avoid mentioning that:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>The individual was apprehended near the crime scene.</li>
        <li>The evidence points to the individual as the suspect.</li>
        <li>Other witnesses have identified, or failed to identify, the individual as the suspect.</li>
    </ul>
    <p>In order to avoid undue influence, witnesses should view suspects or a lineup individually and outside the presence of other witnesses. Witnesses should be instructed to avoid discussing details of the incident or of the identification process with
        other witnesses.</p>
    <p>Whenever feasible, the eyewitness identification procedure should be audio and/or video recorded and the recording should be retained according to current evidence procedures.</p>
    <h4>610.5.1 PHOTOGRAPHIC AND LIVE LINEUP CONSIDERATIONS</h4>
    <p>When practicable, the person composing the lineup and the person presenting the lineup should not be directly involved in the investigation of the case. When this is not possible, the member presenting the lineup must take the utmost care not to communicate
        the identity of the suspect in any way.</p>
    <p>When practicable, the employee presenting a lineup to a witness should not know which photograph or person is the suspect.</p>
    <p>Other persons or photos used in any lineup should bear similar characteristics to the suspect to avoid causing him/her to unreasonably stand out. In cases involving multiple suspects, a separate lineup should be conducted for each suspect. The suspects
        should be placed in a different order within each lineup.</p>
    <p>The employee presenting the lineup to a witness should do so sequentially and not simultaneously (i.e., show the witness one person at a time). The witness should view all persons in the lineup.</p>
    <p>The order of the suspect or the photos and the fillers should be randomized before being presented to each witness.</p>
    <p>A live lineup should only be used before criminal proceedings have been initiated against the suspect. If there is any question as to whether any criminal proceedings have begun, the investigating officer should contact the appropriate prosecuting
        attorney before proceeding.</p>
    <h4>610.5.2 FIELD IDENTIFICATION CONSIDERATIONS</h4>
    <p>Field identifications, also known as field elimination show-ups or one-on-one identifications, may be helpful in certain cases, where exigent circumstances make it impracticable to conduct a photo or live lineup identifications. A field elimination
        or show-up identification should not be used when independent probable cause exists to arrest a suspect. In such cases a live or photo lineup is the preferred course of action if eyewitness identification is contemplated.</p>
    <p>When initiating a field identification, the officer should observe the following guidelines:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Obtain a complete description of the suspect from the witness.</li>
        <li>Assess whether a witness should be included in a field identification process by considering:
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>The length of time the witness observed the suspect.</li>
                <li>The distance between the witness and the suspect.</li>
                <li>Whether the witness could view the suspect's face.</li>
                <li>The quality of the lighting when the suspect was observed by the witness.</li>
                <li>Whether there were distracting noises or activity during the observation.</li>
                <li>Any other circumstances affecting the witness's opportunity to observe the suspect.</li>
                <li>The length of time that has elapsed since the witness observed the suspect.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>If safe and practicable, the person who is the subject of the show-up should not be handcuffed or in a patrol vehicle.</li>
        <li>When feasible, officers should bring the witness to the location of the suspect, rather than bring the suspect to the witness.</li>
        <li>A person should not be shown to the same witness more than once.</li>
        <li>In cases involving multiple suspects, witnesses should only be permitted to view the suspects one at a time.</li>
        <li>A person in a field identification should not be required to put on clothing worn by the suspect, to speak words uttered by the suspect or to perform other actions mimicking those of the suspect.</li>
        <li>If a witness positively identifies an individual as the perpetrator, officers should not conduct any further field identifications with other witnesses for that suspect. In such instances</li>
    </ol>
    <p>officers should document the contact information for any additional witnesses for follow up, if necessary.</p>

    <h3>610.6 DOCUMENTATION</h3>
    <p>A thorough description of the eyewitness process and the results of any eyewitness identification should be documented in the case report. Witness comments of how certain he/she is of the identification or non-identification should be quoted in the
        report. Officers shall also record the eye witness identification process with their squad MVR whenever it is available to them.</p>
    <p>If a photographic lineup is utilized, a copy of the photographic lineup presented to the witness should be included in the case report. In addition, the order in which the photographs were presented to the witness should be documented in the case
        report.

    <h2>612 - Brady Material Disclosure</h2>
    <h3>612.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>This policy establishes guidelines for identifying and releasing potentially exculpatory or impeachment information (so-called "<em>Brady </em>information") to a prosecuting attorney.</p>
    <h4>612.1.1 DEFINITIONS</h4>
    <p>Definitions related to this policy include:</p>
    <p><strong><em>Brady</em> information</strong> - Information known or possessed by the Metro Transit Police Department that is both favorable and material to the current prosecution or defense of a criminal defendant.</p>

    <h3>612.2 POLICY</h3>
    <p>The Metro Transit Police Department will conduct fair and impartial criminal investigations and will provide the prosecution with both incriminating and exculpatory evidence as well as information that may adversely affect the credibility of a witness.
        In addition to reporting all evidence of guilt, the Metro Transit Police Department will assist the prosecution by complying with its obligation to disclose information that is both favorable and material to the defense. The Department will identify
        and disclose to the prosecution potentially exculpatory information as provided in this policy.</p>

    <h3>612.3 DISCLOSURE OF INVESTIGATIVE INFORMATION</h3>
    <p>Officers must include in their investigative reports adequate investigative information and reference to all material evidence and facts that are reasonably believed to be either incriminating or exculpatory to any individual in the case. If an officer
        learns of potentially incriminating or exculpatory information any time after submission of a case, the officer or the handling investigator must prepare and submit a supplemental report documenting such information as soon as practicable. Supplemental
        reports shall be promptly processed and transmitted to the prosecutor's office.</p>
    <p>If information is believed to be privileged or confidential (e.g., confidential informant or protected personnel files), the officer should discuss the matter with a supervisor and/or prosecutor to determine the appropriate manner in which to proceed.</p>
    <p>Evidence or facts are considered material if there is a reasonable probability that they would affect the outcome of a criminal proceeding or trial. Determining whether evidence or facts are material often requires legal or even judicial review. If
        an officer is unsure whether evidence or facts are material, the officer should address the issue with a supervisor.</p>
    <p>Supervisors who are uncertain about whether evidence or facts are material should address the issue in a written memo to an appropriate prosecutor. A copy of the memo should be retained in the Department case file.</p>

    <h3>612.4 DISCLOSURE OF PERSONNEL INFORMATION</h3>
    <p>If a member of this department is a material witness in a criminal case, a person or persons designated by the Chief of Police shall examine the personnel file and/or internal affairs file of the officer to determine whether they contain <em>Brady</em>        information. If <em>Brady</em> information is located, the following procedure shall apply:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>In the event that a motion has not already been filed by the criminal defendant or other party, the prosecuting attorney and department member shall be notified of the potential presence of <em>Brady </em>material in the member's personnel file.</li>
        <li>If the data is classified as public data, a copy of it shall be provided to the prosecuting attorney. In the case of non-public data, the prosecuting attorney should then be requested to file a motion in order to initiate an in camera review by
            the court.
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>If no motion is filed, the supervisor should work with counsel to determine whether the records should be disclosed to the prosecutor.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>The Custodian of Records shall accompany all relevant personnel files during any in camera inspection to address any issues or questions raised by the court.</li>
        <li>If the court determines that there is relevant <em>Brady </em>material contained in the files, only that data ordered released will be copied and released to the parties filing the motion.</p>
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>Prior to the release of any materials pursuant to this process, the Custodian of Records should request a protective order from the court limiting the use and further dissemination of such materials to the involved case and requiring the
                    return of all copies upon completion of the case.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>If a court has determined that relevant <em>Brady </em>information is contained in the member's file in any case, the prosecutor should be notified of that fact in all future cases involving that member.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The person or persons designated by the Chief of Police should periodically examine the personnel files and/or internal affairs files of all officers who may be material witnesses in criminal cases to determine whether they contain <em>Brady </em>information.
        The obligation to provide <em>Brady </em>information is ongoing. If any new <em>Brady </em>information is identified, the prosecuting attorney should be notified.</p>

    <h3>612.5 INVESTIGATING BRADY ISSUES</h3>
    <p>If the Department receives information from any source that a member may have issues of credibility, dishonesty or has been engaged in an act of moral turpitude or criminal conduct, the information shall be investigated and processed in accordance
        with the Personnel Complaints Policy.</p>

    <h3>612.6 TRAINING</h3>
    <p>Department personnel should receive periodic training on the requirements of this policy.</p>
</div>
            <div class="chapter" id="613">
    <h2>613 - Warrant Service</h2>
    <h3>613.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>This policy establishes guidelines for the planning and serving of arrest and search warrants by members of this department. It is understood that this policy cannot address every variable or circumstance that can arise in the service of a search
        or arrest warrant, as these tasks can involve rapidly evolving and unique circumstances.</p>
    <p>This policy is intended to be used in conjunction with the Operations Planning and Deconfliction Policy, which has additional guidance on planning and serving high-risk warrants.</p>
    <p>This policy is not intended to address the service of search warrants on locations or property already secured or routine field warrant arrests by patrol officers.</p>

    <h3>613.2 POLICY</h3>
    <p>It is the policy of the Metro Transit Police Department to balance the safety needs of the public, the safety of department members, privacy interests and other relevant factors when making decisions related to the service of search and arrest warrants.</p>

    <h3>613.3 OPERATIONS DIRECTOR / INVESTIGATIVE SUPERVISOR</h3>
    <p>The operations director / investigative supervisor (see the Operations Planning and Deconfliction Policy) shall review all risk assessment forms with the involved supervisor to determine the risk level of the warrant service.</p>
    <p>The operations director will also have the responsibility to coordinate service of those warrants that are categorized as high risk. Deconfliction, risk assessment, operational planning, briefing and debriefing should follow guidelines in the Operations
        Planning and Deconfliction Policy.</p>

    <h3>613.4 SEARCH WARRANTS</h3>
    <p>Officers should receive authorization from a supervisor before preparing a search warrant application. Once authorization is received, the officer will prepare the affidavit and search warrant, consulting with the applicable prosecuting attorney as
        needed. He/she will also complete the risk assessment form and submit it, along with the warrant affidavit, to the appropriate supervisor and the operations director / investigative supervisor for review and classification of risk (see the Operations
        Planning and Deconfliction Policy).

        <h3>613.5 ARREST WARRANTS</h3>
        <p>If an officer reasonably believes that serving an arrest warrant may pose a higher risk than commonly faced on a daily basis, the officer should complete the risk assessment form and submit it to the appropriate supervisor and the operations director
            / investigative supervisor for review and classification of risk (see the Operations Planning and Deconfliction Policy).</p>
        <p>If the warrant is classified as high risk, service will be coordinated by the operations director / investigative supervisor. If the warrant is not classified as high risk, the supervisor should weigh the risk of entry into a residence to make
            an arrest against other alternatives, such as arresting the person outside the residence where circumstances may pose a lower risk.</p>

        <h3>613.6 WARRANT PREPARATION</h3>
        <p>An officer who prepares a warrant should ensure the documentation in support of the warrant contains as applicable:</p>
        <ol class="alpha">
            <li>Probable cause to support the search or arrest, including relevant dates and times to demonstrate timeliness and facts to support any request for nighttime or no-knock warrant execution.</li>
            <li>A clear explanation of the affiant’s training, experience and relevant education.</li>
            <li>Adequately supported opinions, when relevant, that are not left to unsubstantiated conclusions.</li>
            <li>A nexus between the place to be searched and the persons or items central to the investigation. The facts supporting this nexus should be clear and current. For example, the affidavit shall explain why there is probable cause to believe that
                a particular person is currently residing at a particular location or that the items sought are present at a particular location.</li>
            <li>Full disclosure of known or suspected residents at the involved location and any indication of separate living spaces at the involved location. For example, it should be disclosed that several people may be renting bedrooms at a single location,
                even if the exact location of the rooms is not known.</li>
            <li>A specific description of the location to be searched, including photographs of the location, if reasonably available.</li>
            <li>A sufficient description of the items to be seized.</li>
            <li>Full disclosure of any known exculpatory information relevant to the warrant application (refer to the <em>Brady</em> Material Disclosure Policy).</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>613.7 HIGH-RISK WARRANT SERVICE</h3>
        <p>The operations director / investigative supervisor or the authorized designee shall coordinate the service of warrants that are categorized as high risk and shall have sole authority in determining the manner in which the warrant will be served,
            including the number of officers deployed.</p>
        <p>The member responsible for directing the service should ensure the following as applicable:</p>
        <ol class="alpha">
            <li>When practicable and when doing so does not cause unreasonable risk, video or photographic documentation is made of the condition of the location prior to execution of a search warrant. The images should include the surrounding area and persons
                present.
            </li>
            <li>The warrant service is audio- and video-recorded when practicable and reasonable to do so.</li>
            <li>Evidence is handled and collected only by those members who are designated to do so. All other members involved in the service of the warrant should alert one of the designated members to the presence of potential evidence and not touch or
                disturb the items.</li>
            <li>Reasonable efforts are made during the search to maintain or restore the condition of the location.</li>
            <li>Persons who are detained as part of the warrant service are handled appropriately under the circumstances.</li>
            <li>Reasonable care provisions are made for children and dependent adults (see the Child and Dependent Adult Safety Policy).</li>
            <li>A list is made of all items seized and a copy provided to the person in charge of the premises if present or otherwise left in a conspicuous place.</li>
            <li>A copy of the search warrant is left at the location.</li>
            <li>The condition of the property is documented with video recording or photographs after the search.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>613.8 DETENTIONS DURING WARRANT SERVICE</h3>
        <p>Officers must be sensitive to the safety risks of all persons involved with the service of a warrant. Depending on circumstances and facts present, it may be appropriate to control movements of any or all persons present at a warrant service,
            including those who may not be the subject of a warrant or suspected in the case. However, officers must be mindful that only reasonable force may be used and weapons should be displayed no longer than the officer reasonably believes is necessary
            (see the Use of Force Policy).</p>
        <p>As soon as it can be determined that an individual is not subject to the scope of a warrant and that no further reasonable suspicion or safety concerns exist to justify further detention, the person should be promptly released.</p>
        <p>Officers should, when and to the extent reasonable, accommodate the privacy and personal needs of people who have been detained.</p>

        <h3>613.9 ACTIONS AFTER WARRANT SERVICE</h3>
        <p>The supervisor shall ensure that all affidavits, warrants, receipts and returns, regardless of any associated cases, are filed with the issuing court as soon as reasonably possible, but in any event no later than any date specified on the warrant
            or by rules established by the court.</p>

        <h3>613.10 OUTSIDE AGENCIES AND CROSS-JURISDICTIONAL WARRANTS</h3>
        <p>The operations director / investigative supervisor will ensure that cooperative efforts with other agencies in the service of warrants conform to existing mutual aid agreements or other memorandums of understanding and will work cooperatively
            to mitigate risks including, but not limited to, the following:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Identity of team members</li>
            <li>Roles and responsibilities</li>
            <li>Familiarity with equipment</li>
            <li>Rules of engagement</li>
            <li>Asset forfeiture procedures</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Any outside agency requesting assistance in the service of a warrant within this jurisdiction should be referred to the operations director / investigative supervisor. The director should review and confirm the warrant, including the warrant location,
            and should discuss the service with the appropriate supervisor from the other agency. The director should ensure that members of the Metro Transit Police Department are utilized appropriately. Any concerns regarding the requested use of Metro
            Transit Police Department members should be brought to the attention of the Chief of Police or the authorized designee. The actual service of the warrant will remain the responsibility of the agency requesting assistance.</p>
        <p>If the operations director / investigative supervisor is unavailable, the Shift Supervisor (Lieutenant) should assume this role.</p>
        <p>If officers intend to serve a warrant outside Metro Transit Police Department jurisdiction, the operations director / investigative supervisor should provide reasonable advance notice to the applicable agency, request assistance as needed and
            work cooperatively on operational planning and the mitigation of risks detailed in this policy.</p>
        <p>Officers will remain subject to the policies of the Metro Transit Police Department when assisting outside agencies or serving a warrant outside Metro Transit Police Department jurisdiction.</p>

        <h3>613.11 MEDIA ACCESS</h3>
        <p>No advance information regarding warrant service operations shall be released without the approval of the Chief of Police. Any media inquiries or press release after the fact shall be handled in accordance with the Media Relations Policy.</p>

        <h3>613.12 TRAINING</h3>
        <p>The Training Supervisor should ensure officers whose job duties require it, receive periodic training on this policy and associated topics, such as legal issues, warrant preparation, warrant service and reporting requirements.</p>

    <h2>614 - Operations Planning and Deconfliction</h2>
    <h3>614.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>This policy provides guidelines for planning, deconfliction and execution of high-risk operations.</p>
    <p>Additional guidance on planning and serving high-risk warrants is provided in the Warrant Service Policy.</p>
    <h4>614.1.1 DEFINITIONS</h4>
    <p>Definitions related to this policy include:</p>
    <p><strong>High-risk operations</strong> - Operations, including service of search and arrest warrants and sting operations, that are likely to present higher risks than are commonly faced by officers on a daily basis, including suspected fortified locations,
        reasonable risk of violence or confrontation with multiple persons, or reason to suspect that persons anticipate the operation.</p>

    <h3>614.2 POLICY</h3>
    <p>It is the policy of the Metro Transit Police Department to properly plan and carry out high- risk operations, including participation in a regional deconfliction system, in order to provide coordination, enhance the safety of members and the public,
        decrease the risk of compromising investigations and prevent duplicating efforts.</p>

    <h3>614.3 OPERATIONS DIRECTOR / INVESTIGATIVE SUPERVISOR</h3>
    <p>The Chief of Police will designate a member of this department to be the operations director (typically the Investigative Supervisor).</p>
    <p>The operations director / investigative supervisor will develop and maintain a risk assessment form to assess, plan and coordinate operations. This form should provide a process to identify high-risk operations.</p>
    <p>The operations director / investigative supervisor will review risk assessment forms with involved supervisors to determine whether a particular incident qualifies as a high-risk operation. The director will also have the responsibility for coordinating
        operations that are categorized as high risk.</p>

    <h3>614.4 RISK ASSESSMENT</h3>
    <h4>614.4.1 RISK ASSESSMENT FORM PREPARATION</h4>
    <p>Officers assigned as operational leads for any operation that may qualify as a high-risk operation shall complete a risk assessment form.</p>
    <p>When preparing the form, the officer should query all relevant and reasonably available intelligence resources for information about the subject of investigation, others who may be present and the involved location. These sources may include regional
        intelligence and criminal justice databases,</p>
    <p>target deconfliction systems, firearm records, commercial databases and property records. Where appropriate, the officer should also submit information to these resources.</p>
    <p>The officer should gather available information that includes, but is not limited to:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Photographs, including aerial photographs, if available, of the involved location, neighboring yards and obstacles.</li>
        <li>Maps of the location.</li>
        <li>Diagrams of any property and the interior of any buildings that are involved.</li>
        <li>Historical information about the subject of investigation (e.g., history of weapon possession or use, known mental illness, known drug use, threats against police, gang affiliation, criminal history).</li>
        <li>Historical information about others who may be present at the location (e.g., other criminals, innocent third parties, dependent adults, children, animals).</li>
        <li>Obstacles associated with the location (e.g., fortification, booby traps, reinforced doors/ windows, surveillance measures, number and type of buildings, geographic and perimeter barriers, the number and types of weapons likely to be present,
            information that suggests the presence of explosives, chemicals or other hazardous materials, the potential for multiple dwellings or living spaces, availability of keys/door combinations).</li>
        <li>Other environmental factors (e.g., nearby venues such as schools and day care centers, proximity of adjacent homes or other occupied buildings, anticipated pedestrian and vehicle traffic at the time of service).</li>
        <li>Other available options that may minimize the risk to officers and others (e.g., making an off-site arrest or detention of the subject of investigation).</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>614.4.2 RISK ASSESSMENT REVIEW</h4>
    <p>Officers will present the risk assessment form and other relevant documents (such as copies of search warrants and affidavits and arrest warrants) to their supervisor and the operations director/ investigative supervisor.</p>
    <p>The supervisor and operations director / investigative supervisor shall confer and determine the level of risk. Supervisors should take reasonable actions if there is a change in circumstances that elevates the risks associated with the operation.</p>
    <h4>614.4.3 HIGH-RISK OPERATIONS</h4>
    <p>If the operations director / investigative supervisor, after consultation with the involved supervisor, determines that the operation is high risk, the operations director / investigative supervisor should:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Determine what resources will be needed at the location, and contact and/or place on standby any of the following appropriate and available resources:
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>Local agency tactical team</li>
                <li>Additional personnel</li>
                <li>Outside agency assistance</li>
                <li>Special equipment</li>
                <li>Medical personnel</li>
                <li>Persons trained in negotiation</li>
                <li>Additional surveillance</li>
                <li>Canines</li>
                <li>Property and Evidence or analytical personnel to assist with cataloguing seizures</li>
                <li>Forensic specialists</li>
                <li>Specialized mapping for larger or complex locations</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Contact the appropriate department members or other agencies as warranted to begin preparation.</li>
        <li>Ensure that all legal documents such as search warrants are complete and have any modifications reasonably necessary to support the operation.</li>
        <li>Coordinate the actual operation.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>614.5 DECONFLICTION</h3>
    <p>Deconfliction systems are designed to identify persons and locations associated with investigations or law enforcement operations and alert participating agencies when others are planning or conducting operations in close proximity or time or are
        investigating the same individuals, groups or locations.</p>
    <p>The officer who is the operations lead shall ensure the subject of investigation and operations information have been entered in an applicable deconfliction system to determine if there is reported conflicting activity. This should occur as early
        in the process as practicable, but no later than two hours prior to the commencement of the operation. The officer should also enter relevant updated information when it is received.</p>
    <p>If any conflict is discovered, the supervisor will contact the involved jurisdiction and resolve the potential conflict before proceeding.</p>

    <h3>614.6 OPERATIONS PLAN</h3>
    <p>The operations director / investigative supervisor should ensure that a written operations plan is developed for all high-risk operations. Plans should also be considered for other operations that would benefit from having a formal plan.</p>
    <p>The plan should address such issues as:</p>
    <ol class="apha">
        <li>Operation goals, objectives and strategies.</li>
        <li>Operation location and people:
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>The subject of investigation (e.g., history of weapon possession/use, known mental illness issues, known drug use, threats against police, gang affiliation, criminal history)</li>
                <li>The location (e.g., fortification, booby traps, reinforced doors/windows, surveillance cameras and/or lookouts, number/type of buildings, geographic and perimeter barriers, the number and types of weapons likely to be present, information
                    that suggests the presence of explosives, chemicals or other hazardous materials, the potential for multiple dwellings or living spaces, availability of keys/door combinations), including aerial photos, if available, and maps of neighboring
                    yards and obstacles, diagrams and other visual aids</li>
                <li>Other environmental factors (e.g., nearby venues such as schools and day care centers, proximity of adjacent homes or other occupied buildings, anticipated pedestrian and vehicle traffic at the time of service)</li>
                <li>Identification of other people who may be present in or around the operation, such as other criminal suspects, innocent third parties and children</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Information from the risk assessment form by attaching a completed copy in the operational plan.
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>The volume or complexity of the information may indicate that the plan includes a synopsis of the information contained on the risk assessment form to ensure clarity and highlighting of critical information.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Participants and their roles.
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>An adequate number of uniformed officers should be included in the operation team to provide reasonable notice of a legitimate law enforcement operation.</li>
                <li>How all participants will be identified as law enforcement.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Whether deconfliction submissions are current and all involved individuals, groups and locations have been deconflicted to the extent reasonably practicable.</li>
        <li>Identification of all communications channels and call-signs.</li>
        <li>Use of force issues.</li>
        <li>Contingencies for handling medical emergencies (e.g., services available at the location, closest hospital, closest trauma center).</li>
        <li>Plans for detaining people who are not under arrest.</li>
        <li>Contingencies for handling children, dependent adults, animals and other people who might be at the location in accordance with the Child Abuse, Adult Abuse, Child and Dependent Adult Safety and Animal Control policies.</li>
        <li>Communications plan.</li>
        <li>Responsibilities for writing, collecting, reviewing and approving reports.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>614.6.1 OPERATIONS PLAN RETENTION</h4>
    <p>Since the operations plan contains intelligence information and descriptions of law enforcement tactics, it shall not be filed with the report. The operations plan shall be stored separately and retained in accordance with the established records
        retention schedule.</p>

    <h3>614.7 OPERATIONS BRIEFING</h3>
    <p>A briefing should be held prior to the commencement of any high-risk operation to allow all participants to understand the operation, see and identify each other, identify roles and responsibilities and ask questions or seek clarification as needed.
        Anyone who is not present at the briefing should not respond to the operation location without specific supervisory approval.</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>The briefing should include a verbal review of plan elements, using visual aids, to enhance the participants’ understanding of the operations plan.</li>
        <li>All participants should be provided a copy of the operations plan and search warrant, if applicable. Participating personnel should be directed to read the search warrant and initial a copy that is retained with the operation plan. Any items to
            be seized should be identified at the briefing.</li>
        <li>The operations director / investigative supervisor shall ensure that all participants are visually identifiable as law enforcement officers.
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>Exceptions may be made by the operations director / investigative supervisor for officers who are conducting surveillance or working under cover. However, those members exempt from visual identification should be able to transition to
                    a visible law enforcement indicator at the time of enforcement actions, such as entries or arrests, if necessary.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>The briefing should include details of the communications plan.
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>It is the responsibility of the operations director to ensure that Transit Control Center is notified of the time and location of the operation, and to provide a copy of the operation plan prior to officers arriving at the location.</li>
                <li>If the radio channel needs to be monitored by Transit Control Center, the dispatcher assigned to monitor the operation should attend the briefing, if practicable, but at a minimum should receive a copy of the operation plan.</li>
                <li>The briefing should include a communications check to ensure that all participants are able to communicate with the available equipment on the designated radio channel.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>

    <h3>614.8 TACTICAL TEAM PARTICIPATION</h3>
    <p>If the operations director / investigative supervisor determines that tactical team participation is appropriate, the director and the tactical team supervisor shall work together to develop a written plan. The tactical team supervisor shall assume
        operational control until all persons at the scene are appropriately detained and it is safe to begin a search. When this occurs, the tactical team supervisor shall transfer control of the scene to the handling supervisor. This transfer should
        be communicated to the officers present.</p>

    <h3>614.9 MEDIA ACCESS</h3>
    <p>No advance information regarding planned operations shall be released without the approval of the Chief of Police. Any media inquiries or press release after the fact shall be handled in accordance with the Media Relations Policy.</p>

    <h3>614.10 OPERATIONS DEBRIEFING</h3>
    <p>High-risk operations should be debriefed as soon as reasonably practicable. The debriefing should include as many participants as possible. This debrief may be separate from any tactical team debriefing.</p>

    <h3>614.11 TRAINING</h3>
    <p>The Training Supervisor should ensure officers who participate in operations subject to this policy should receive periodic training including, but not limited to, topics such as legal issues, deconfliction practices, operations planning concepts
        and reporting requirements.</p>

    <h2>615 - Scrap Metal Theft Investigation</h2>
    <h3>615.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>This policy provides guidance regarding scrap metal theft investigations.</p>
    <h4>615.1.1 DEFINITIONS</h4>
    <p>Definitions related to this policy include:</p>
    <p><strong>Scrap vehicle operator or operator</strong> - A person described in Minn. Stat. § 168A.1501 who engages in a transaction involving the purchase or acquisition of a scrap vehicle.</p>
    <p><strong>Scrap metal dealer or dealer</strong> - A person engaged in the business of buying or selling scrap metal, or both, as defined in Minn. Stat. § 325E.21.</p>

    <h3>615.2 POLICY</h3>
    <p>The Metro Transit Police Department recognizes the difficulty in preventing scrap metal theft and may investigate, place holds on or confiscate items as provided in this policy.</p>

    <h3>615.3 INSPECTIONS</h3>
    <p>An officer engaged in scrap metal theft investigations may (Minn. Stat. § 168A.1501; Minn. Stat. § 325E.21):</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Conduct inspections of any purchase and acquisition records maintained by scrap vehicle operators or scrap metal dealers.</li>
        <li>Inspect scrap vehicle or scrap metal received by an operator or dealer at any reasonable time.</li>
        <li>Inspect any video or still camera and any recordings or images required to be maintained by an operator or dealer.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Any refusal to allow such inspections should be referred to the local jurisdiction's attorney for criminal prosecution.</p>

    <h3>615.4 INVESTIGATIVE HOLDS</h3>
    <p>An officer who has probable cause to believe that a scrap vehicle or motor vehicle parts in the possession of a scrap vehicle operator, or that scrap metal in the possession of a scrap metal dealer, is stolen or is evidence of a crime may verbally
        order the operator or dealer not to process, sell, remove or allow the removal of the item for 30 days (Minn. Stat. § 168A.1501; Minn. Stat. § 325E.21).</p>
    <p>The officer issuing the order is responsible for ensuring that the order to hold the item is confirmed in writing within 72 hours. If the item is identified as evidence in an active criminal case, the officer may extend the hold in writing. This extension
        must occur within 30 days of the original order and may remain in effect for as long as the investigation or prosecution is active.</p>

    <h3>615.5 SEIZING ITEMS</h3>
    <p>The investigating officer should confer with the prosecuting attorney to determine whether the item should be confiscated. If the item is evidence or otherwise needed for an investigation or prosecution, the officer may issue a written notice to confiscate
        any time during the investigative hold. The officer shall take custody of the item within 15 days of the notice to confiscate (Minn. Stat. § 168A.1501; Minn. Stat. § 325E.21).</p>
    <p>When an item is confiscated, the officer shall:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Provide the operator or dealer a property receipt that includes at least the following:
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>The name and telephone number of the Department.</li>
                <li>The name and telephone number of the officer.</li>
                <li>The case number related to the confiscation.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Deliver the item to the Property and Evidence.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>When a confiscated item is no longer needed for an investigation or prosecution, it may be returned to a registered owner only after giving the operator or dealer from whom the item was seized written notice of intent to do so. The written notice
        should include notice of the right of the operator or dealer to make a written request for return of the item and that if the Department does not return the item within 48 hours of the request, excluding Saturday, Sunday or legal holidays, the
        operator or dealer may file a petition for the return of the item in the district court in the district in which the property was seized (Minn. Stat. § 626.04).</p>

    <h3>615.6 TERMINATION OF HOLD OR NOTICE TO CONFISCATE</h3>
    <p>At the conclusion of any investigation and prosecution, the officer who issued the investigative hold or a notice to confiscate property not yet confiscated shall notify the operator or dealer in writing that the hold or notice is no longer in effect
        (Minn. Stat. § 168A.1501; Minn. Stat. § 325E.21).</p>

    <h3>615.7 AUTOMATED PROPERTY SYSTEM</h3>
    <p>The Investigation Division supervisor is responsible for ensuring that the Department complies with the implementation and use of the Automated Property System (APS) (Minn. Stat. § 168A.1501; Minn. Stat. § 325E.21).</p>
</div>

            <div class="chapter" id="700">
	<h2>700 - Department-Owned and Personal Property</h2>
	<h3>700.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
	<p>Department employees are expected to properly care for Department property assigned or entrusted to them. Employees may also suffer occasional loss or damage to personal or department property while performing their assigned duties. Certain procedures

	<ol class="alpha">
		<li>Employees shall promptly report through the chain of command, any loss, damage to or unserviceable condition of any department-issued property or equipment assigned for their use.
			<ol class="decimal">
				<li>A supervisor receiving such a report shall make an appropriate investigation and direct a memo to their appropriate supervisor that shall include the result of his/her investigation and whether the employee followed proper procedures. The supervisor's
					report shall address whether reasonable care was taken to prevent the loss, damage or unserviceable condition.</li>
				<li>A review by Staff to determine whether misconduct or negligence was involved should be completed.</li>
			</ol>
		</li>
		<li>The use of damaged or unserviceable department property should be discontinued as soon as practicable and, if appropriate and approved by staff, replaced with comparable Department property as soon as available and following notice to a supervisor.</li>
		<li>Except when otherwise directed by competent authority or required by exigent circumstances, Department property shall only be used by those to whom it was assigned. Use should be limited to official purposes and in the capacity for which it was designed.
		</li>
		<li>Department property shall not be thrown away, sold, traded, donated, destroyed or otherwise disposed of without proper authority.</li>
		<li>In the event that any Department property becomes damaged or unserviceable, no employee shall attempt to repair the property without prior approval of a supervisor.</li>
	</ol>

	<h3>700.3 USE OF PERSONAL PROPERTY</h3>
	<p>The carrying of personal equipment on-duty or its use in the performance of duties requires prior written approval by the Chief of Police or designee. The employee should submit for approval the description of personal property the employee has requested
		to carry, the reason for its use and the term of its use. Personal property of the type routinely carried by persons not performing law enforcement duties nor comprising a weapon are excluded from this requirement. The Chief of Police or designee should
		review the request and approve or deny the request as appropriate.</p>
	<h4>700.3.1 DEFINITIONS</h3>
    <p><strong>Personal Property</strong> - Items or equipment owned by, provided by or purchased totally at the expense of the employee. This definition includes optional equipment items identified in the Uniform Regulations Policy.</p>
    <h4>700.3.2 FILING CLAIMS FOR PERSONAL PROPERTY</h4>
	<p>Claims for reimbursement for damage or loss of personal property must be made on the proper form. This form is submitted to the employee's immediate supervisor. The supervisor may require a separate written report of the loss or damage.</p>
	<p>The supervisor receiving such a report shall make an appropriate investigation and direct a memo to their supervisor that shall include the result of his/her investigation and whether reasonable care was taken to prevent the loss, damage or unserviceable
		condition.
	</p>
	<p>Upon review by staff and a finding that no misconduct or negligence was involved, repair or replacement may be recommended by the Chief of Police, who will then forward the claim to the Finance Department.</p>
	<p>The Department will not replace or repair costly items (e.g., jewelry, exotic equipment) that are not reasonably required as a part of work.</p>
	<h4>700.3.3 REPORTING REQUIREMENT</h4>
	<p>A verbal report shall be made to the employee's immediate supervisor as soon as circumstances permit.</p>
	<p>A written report shall be submitted before the employee goes off-duty or within the time frame directed by the supervisor to whom the verbal report is made.</p>

	<h3>700.4 LOSS OR DAMAGE OF PROPERTY OF ANOTHER</h3>

	<ol class="alpha">
		<li>A verbal report shall be made to the employee's immediate supervisor as reasonably soon as circumstances permit.</li>
		<li>A written report shall be submitted before the employee goes off-duty or within the time frame directed by the supervisor to whom the verbal report was made.</li>
	</ol>
	<h4>700.4.1 DAMAGE BY PERSON OF ANOTHER AGENCY</h4>

            <div class="chapter" id="702">
    <h2>702 - Personal Communication Devices</h2>
    <h3>702.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this policy is to establish guidelines for the use of mobile telephones and communication devices whether issued or funded by the Department or personally owned, while on-duty or when used for authorized work-related purposes.</p>
    <p>This policy generically refers to all such devices as Personal Communication Devices (PCD) but is intended to include all mobile telephones, personal digital assistants (PDA) and similar wireless two-way communications and/or portable Internet access
        devices. PCD use includes, but is not limited to, placing and receiving calls, text messaging, blogging and microblogging, e-mailing, using video or camera features, playing games and accessing sites or services on the Internet.</p>

    <h3>702.2 POLICY</h3>
    <p>The Metro Transit Police Department allows employees to utilize department-issued or funded PCDs and to possess personally owned PCDs in the workplace subject to certain limitations. Any PCD used while on-duty, or used off-duty in any manner reasonably
        related to the business of the Department, will be subject to monitoring and inspection consistent with the standards set forth in this policy.</p>
    <p>The inappropriate use of a PCD while on-duty may impair officer safety. Additionally employees are advised and cautioned that the use of a personally owned PCD either on-duty or after duty hours for business-related purposes may subject the employee
        and the employee’s PCD records to civil or criminal discovery or disclosure under applicable data practices laws and rules of civil or criminal procedures.</p>
    <p>Employees who have questions regarding the application of this policy or the guidelines contained herein are encouraged to seek clarification from supervisory personnel.</p>

    <h3>702.3 PRIVACY POLICY</h3>
    <p>Employees shall have no expectation of privacy with regard to any communication made with or stored in or through PCDs issued by the Department and shall have no expectation of privacy in their location should the device be equipped with location
        detection capabilities. The use of any department-provided or -funded PCD, computer, Internet service, telephone service or other wireless service while on-duty is without any expectation of privacy that the employee might otherwise have in any
        communication, including the content of any such communication. Communications or data reception on personal, password-protected, web-based e-mail accounts and any other services are subject to monitoring if department equipment is used.</p>
    <p>In accordance with this policy, supervisors are authorized to conduct a limited administrative search of electronic files without prior notice, consent or a search warrant, on department- issued or personally owned PCDs that have been used to conduct
        department-related business. Administrative searches can take place for work-related purposes that may be unrelated to investigations of employee misconduct and, as reasonably practicable, will be done in the presence of the affected employee.
        Prior to conducting any search of personally owned devices, supervisors shall consult with the Chief of Police or designee. All such searches shall be fully documented in a written report.</p>

    <h3>702.4 DEPARTMENT-ISSUED PCD</h3>
    <p>Depending on an employee’s assignment and the needs of the position, the Department may at its discretion issue or fund a PCD. Department-issued or funded PCDs are provided as a convenience to facilitate on-duty performance only. Such devices and
        the associated telephone number shall remain the sole property of the Department and shall be subject to inspection or monitoring (including all related records and content) at any time without notice and without cause.</p>
    <p>Unless an employee is expressly authorized by the Chief of Police or the authorized designee for off-duty use of the PCD, the PCD will either be secured in the workplace at the completion of the tour of duty or will be turned off when leaving the
        workplace.</p>

    <h3>702.5 PERSONALLY OWNED PCD</h3>
    <p>Employees may carry a personally owned PCD while on-duty subject to the following conditions and limitations:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Carrying a personally owned PCD is a privilege, not a right.</li>
        <li>The Department accepts no responsibility or liability for loss of or damage to a personally owned PCD.</li>
        <li>Employees shall promptly notify the Department in the event the PCD is lost or stolen.</li>
        <li>The PCD and any associated services shall be purchased, used and maintained solely at the employee’s expense.</li>
        <li>The device should not be used for work-related purposes except in exigent circumstances, (e.g. unavailability of radio communications). Employees have a reduced expectation of privacy when using a personally owned PCD in the workplace and have
            no expectation of privacy with regard to any department business-related communication.
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>Members may use personally owned PCDs on-duty for routine administrative work as authorized by the Chief of Police.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>The device shall not be utilized to record or disclose any business-related data, including photographs, video or the recording or transmittal of any data or material obtained or made accessible as a result of employment with the Department, without
            the express authorization of the Chief of Police or the authorized designee.</li>
        <li>Use of a personally owned PCD constitutes consent for the Department to access the PCD to inspect and copy data to meet the needs of the Department, which may include litigation, public records retention and release obligations and internal investigations.
            If the PCD is carried on-duty, employees will provide the Department with all telephone access numbers of the device.</li>
        <li>All work-related documents, e-mails, photographs, recordings or other public records created or received on a member’s personally owned PCD should be transferred to the Metro Transit Police Department and deleted from the member’s PCD as soon
            as reasonably practicable but no later than the end of the member’s shift.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Except with prior express authorization from their supervisor, employees are not obligated or required to carry, access, monitor or respond to electronic communications using a personally owned PCD while off-duty. If an employee is in an authorized
        status that allows for appropriate compensation consistent with policy or existing collective bargaining agreements, or if the employee has prior express authorization from his/her supervisor, the employee may engage in business-related communications.
        Should employees engage in such approved off-duty communications or work, employees entitled to compensation shall promptly document the time worked and communicate the information to their supervisors to ensure appropriate compensation. Employees
        who independently document off-duty department-related business activities in any manner shall promptly provide the Department with a copy of such records to ensure accurate record keeping.</p>
    <h4>702.5.1 PUBLIC RECORDS</h4>
    <p>Work related information including data created, received, recorded or stored on a personally owned PCD in the course of department duties is considered government data subject to the requirements of the Minnesota Government Data Practices Act and
        discovery obligations (Minn. Stat. § 13.01 et seq.).</p>

    <h3>702.6 USE OF PERSONAL COMMUNICATION DEVICES</h3>
    <p>The following protocols shall apply to all PCDs that are carried while on-duty or used to conduct department business:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>A PCD shall not be carried in a manner that allows it to be visible while in uniform unless it is in a carrier approved by the department.</li>
        <li>All PCDs in the workplace shall be set to silent or vibrate mode.</li>
        <li>A PCD may not be used to conduct personal business while on-duty except for brief personal communications (e.g., informing family of extended hours). Employees shall endeavor to limit their use of PCDs to authorized break times unless an emergency
            exists.</li>
        <li>Employees may use a PCD to communicate with other personnel in situations where the use of the radio is either impracticable or not feasible. PCDs should not be used as a substitute for or as a way to avoid or in lieu of regular radio communications.</li>
        <li>Officers are prohibited from taking pictures, video or making audio recordings or making copies of any such picture or recording media unless it is directly related to official department business. Disclosure of any such information to any third
            party through any means without the express authorization of the Chief of Police or the authorized designee or contrary to data practices policies and procedures may result in discipline.</li>
        <li>Employees will not access social networking sites while on-duty for any purpose that is not official department business.</li>
        <li>Using PCDs to harass, threaten, coerce or otherwise engage in inappropriate conduct with any third party is prohibited. Any employee having knowledge of such conduct shall promptly notify a supervisor.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>702.7 SUPERVISORY RESPONSIBILITIES</h3>
    <p>Supervisors should ensure that members under their command are provided appropriate training on the use of PCDs consistent with this policy. Supervisors should monitor, to the extent reasonably practicable, PCD use in the workplace and take prompt
        corrective action if an employee is observed or reported to be improperly using a PCD. An investigation into improper conduct should be promptly initiated when circumstances warrant.</p>
    <p>If, when carrying out any provision of this policy, the need to contact an employee who is off- duty arises, supervisors should consider delaying the contact, if reasonably practicable, until the employee is on-duty as such time may be compensable.</p>

    <h3>702.8 USE WHILE DRIVING</h3>
    <p>The use of a PCD while driving can adversely affect safety, cause unnecessary distractions and present a negative image to the public. Officers operating emergency vehicles should restrict the use of these devices to matters involving official duties
        and, where reasonably practicable, stop the vehicle at an appropriate location to use the PCD (Minn. Stat. § 169.475).</p>
    <p>Except in an emergency, employees who are operating non-emergency vehicles shall not use a PCD while driving unless the device is specifically designed and configured to allow hands-free use (Minn. Stat. § 169.475). Hands-free use should be restricted
        to business-related calls or calls of an urgent nature.</p>

    <h3>702.9 OFFICIAL USE</h3>
    <p>Employees are reminded that PCDs are not secure devices and conversations may be intercepted or overheard. Caution should be exercised while utilizing PCDs to ensure that sensitive data is not inadvertently transmitted. As soon as reasonably possible,
        employees shall change over to conduct sensitive or private communications on a land-based or other department communications network.</p>
    <p>The following situations are examples of when the use of a PCD may be appropriate:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">

    <h2>706 - Vehicle Use</h2>
    <h3>706.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this policy is to establish a system of accountability to ensure department vehicles are used appropriately. This policy provides guidelines for on- and off-duty use of department vehicles and shall not be construed to create or imply
        any contractual obligation by the Metropolitan Council / Metro Transit to provide assigned take-home vehicles.</p>

    <h3>706.2 POLICY</h3>
    <p>The Metro Transit Police Department provides vehicles for department-related business and may assign patrol and unmarked vehicles based on a determination of operational efficiency, economic impact to the Department, requirements for tactical deployments
        and other considerations.</p>

    <h3>706.3 USE OF VEHICLES</h3>
    <h4>706.3.1 SHIFT ASSIGNED VEHICLES</h4>
    <p>The Shift Supervisor shall ensure a copy of the shift assignment roster, indicating member assignments and vehicle numbers, is completed for each shift and retained in accordance with the established records retention schedule. If a member exchanges
        vehicles during his/her shift, the new vehicle number shall be documented on the roster.</p>
    <h4>706.3.2 OTHER USE OF VEHICLES</h4>
    <p>Members utilizing a vehicle for any purpose other than their normally assigned duties or normal vehicle assignment (e.g., transportation to training, community event) shall first notify the Shift Supervisor. A notation will be made on the shift assignment
        roster indicating the member’s name and vehicle number.</p>
    <p>This subsection does not apply to those who are assigned to transport vehicles to and from a maintenance facility or car wash.</p>
    <h4>706.3.3 INSPECTIONS</h4>
    <p>Members shall be responsible for inspecting the interior and exterior of any assigned vehicle before taking the vehicle into service and at the conclusion of their shifts. Any previously unreported damage, mechanical problems, unauthorized contents
        or other problems with the vehicle shall be promptly reported to a supervisor and documented as appropriate.</p>
    <p>The interior of any vehicle that has been used to transport any person other than a member of this department should be inspected prior to placing another person in the vehicle and again after the person is removed. This is to ensure that unauthorized
        or personal items have not been left in the vehicle.</p>
    <p>When transporting any suspect, prisoner or arrestee, the transporting member shall search all areas of the vehicle that are accessible by the person before and after that person is transported.</p>
    <p>All department vehicles are subject to inspection and/or search at any time by a supervisor without notice and without cause. No member assigned to or operating such vehicle shall be entitled to any expectation of privacy with respect to the vehicle
        or its contents.</p>
    <h4>706.3.4 SECURITY AND UNATTENDED VEHICLES</h4>
    <p>Unattended vehicles should be locked and secured at all times. No key should be left in the vehicle except when it is necessary that the vehicle be left running (e.g., continued activation of emergency lights, canine safety, equipment charging). Officers
        who exit a vehicle rapidly in an emergency situation or to engage in a foot pursuit must carefully balance the need to exit the vehicle quickly with the need to secure the vehicle.</p>
    <p>Members shall ensure all weapons are secured while the vehicle is unattended.</p>
    <h4>706.3.5 MOBILE DIGITAL COMPUTER</h4>
    <p>Members assigned to vehicles equipped with a Mobile Digital Computer (MDC) shall log onto the MDC with the required information when going on-duty. If the vehicle is not equipped with a working MDC, the member shall notify Transit Control Center.
        Use of the MDC is governed by the Mobile Digital Computer Use Policy.</p>
    <h4>706.3.6 VEHICLE LOCATION SYSTEM</h4>
    <p>Patrol and other vehicles, at the discretion of the Chief of Police, may be equipped with a system designed to track the vehicle’s location. While the system may provide vehicle location and other information, members are not relieved of their responsibility
        to use required communication practices to report their location and status.</p>
    <p>Members shall not make any unauthorized modifications to the system. At the start of each shift, members shall verify that the system is on and report any malfunctions to their supervisor. If the member finds that the system is not functioning properly
        at any time during the shift, he/she should exchange the vehicle for one with a working system, if available.</p>
    <p>System data may be accessed by supervisors at any time. However, access to historical data by personnel other than supervisors will require Captain approval.</p>
    <p>All data captured by the system shall be retained in accordance with the established records retention schedule.</p>
    <h4>706.3.7 KEYS</h4>
    <p>Members approved to operate marked patrol vehicles should be issued a copy of the key as part of their initial equipment distribution. Members who are assigned a specific vehicle should be issued keys for that vehicle.</p>
    <p>Members shall not duplicate keys. The loss of a key shall be promptly reported in writing through the member’s chain of command.</p>
    <h4>706.3.8 AUTHORIZED PASSENGERS</h4>
    <p>Members operating department vehicles shall not permit persons other than Metropolitan Council / Metro Transit personnel or persons required to be conveyed in the performance of duty, or as otherwise authorized, to ride as passengers in the vehicle,
        except as stated in the Ride- Along Policy.</p>
    <h4>706.3.9 ALCOHOL</h4>
    <p>Members who have consumed alcohol are prohibited from operating any department vehicle unless it is required by the duty assignment (e.g., task force, undercover work). Regardless of assignment, members may not violate state law regarding vehicle
        operation while intoxicated.</p>
    <h4>706.3.10 PARKING</h4>
    <p>Except when responding to an emergency or when urgent department-related business requires otherwise, members driving department vehicles should obey all parking regulations at all times.</p>
    <p>Department vehicles should be parked in assigned stalls. Members shall not park privately owned vehicles in stalls assigned to department vehicles or in other areas of the parking lot that are not so designated unless authorized by a supervisor. Privately
        owned motorcycles shall be parked in designated areas.</p>
    <h4>706.3.11 ACCESSORIES AND/OR MODIFICATIONS</h4>
    <p>There shall be no modifications, additions or removal of any equipment or accessories without written permission from the assigned vehicle program manager.</p>
    <h4>706.3.12 NON-LICENSED MEMBER USE</h4>
    <p>Non-licensed members using marked emergency vehicles shall ensure that all weapons have been removed before going into service. Non-licensed members shall prominently display the "out of service" placards or light bar covers at all times. Non-licensed
        members shall not operate the emergency lights or siren of any vehicle unless expressly authorized by a supervisor.</p>

    <h4>706.4.2 UNSCHEDULED TAKE-HOME USE</h3>
							                                <p>Circumstances may arise where department vehicles must be used by members to commute to and from a work assignment. Members may take home department vehicles only with prior approval of a supervisor and shall meet the following criteria:</p>
							                                <ol class="alpha">
							                                    <li>The circumstances are unplanned and were created by the needs of the Department.</li>
							                                    <li>Other reasonable transportation options are not available.</li>
							                                    <li>The member lives within a reasonable distance (generally not to exceed a 60-minute drive time) of the Metropolitan Council / Metro Transit jurisdiction.</li>

    <h3>710.2 PETTY CASH FUNDS</h3>
    <p>Employees designated as fund managers and authorized to maintain and manage petty cash funds are the Records Supervisor and Administration Supervisor. These persons may delegate this responsibility to another person in their absence. All funds require
        the creation and maintenance of an accurate and current transaction ledger and filing of invoices, receipts and expense reports by the fund manager.</p>

    <h3>710.3 PETTY CASH TRANSACTIONS</h3>
    <p>The fund manager shall document all transactions on the ledger and other appropriate forms and each person participating in the transaction shall sign the ledger attesting to the accuracy of the entry. Transactions should include the filing of an
        appropriate receipt or invoice. Transactions not documented by a receipt, invoice or cash transfer form require an expense report.</p>

    <h3>710.4 PETTY CASH AUDITS</h3>
    <p>The manager of a petty cash fund shall audit the fund no less than once every six months. This audit requires that the manager and at least one other person, selected by the fund manager, review the ledger, records, receipts and funds, verifying the
        accuracy of the accounting. Each participant of the audit shall sign the ledger attesting to the accuracy of all documentation and fund accounting. A discrepancy in the audit requires documentation by those performing the audit and immediate reporting
        of the discrepancy to the Chief of Police.</p>
    <p>Should fund management be transferred to any person, each transfer of this responsibility shall require completion of a separate Petty Cash Audit by those persons involved in the transfer.</p>
    <p>A separate audit by the Chief of Police or the Metropolitan Council should be completed on a random date approximately once each year on each petty cash fund.</p>

    <h3>710.5 ROUTINE CASH HANDLING</h3>
    <p>Members of the Department authorized to routinely handle cash as part of their assignment are property officers. Routine cash handling shall be pursuant to their specific policies (see the Informants and Property and Evidence policies).</p>

    <p>It shall be the responsibility of Transit Control Center to record all relevant information on calls for criminal and non-criminal service or self-initiated activity. Employees shall attempt to elicit, record and share as much information as possible
        to enhance the safety of the officer and assist in anticipating conditions to be encountered at the scene. Desirable information would include, at a minimum, the following:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Control number</li>
        <li>Date and time of request</li>
        <li>Name and address of complainant, if possible</li>
        <li>Type of incident reported</li>
        <li>Involvement of weapons, drugs and/or alcohol</li>
        <li>Location of incident reported</li>
        <li>Identification of officer(s) assigned as primary and backup</li>

        <li>Time of officer's return to service</li>
        <li>Disposition or status of reported incident</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>802.3 RADIO COMMUNICATIONS</h3>
    <p>Operations are more efficient and officer safety is enhanced when dispatchers, supervisors and fellow officers know the status of officers, their locations and the nature of cases.</p>
    <h4>802.3.1 OFFICER IDENTIFICATION</h4>
    <p>Identification systems are based on factors such as beat assignment and officer identification numbers. When calling Transit Control Center or another unit, the calling unit should state the call sign of the called unit followed by their own call
        sign, then pause for the called unit to reply. Employees initiating communication with other agencies shall use their entire call sign. This requirement does not apply to continuing conversation between the mobile unit and dispatcher once the
        mobile unit has been properly identified.</p>

        <li>Complete an evidence/property label and attach it to each package or envelope in which the property is stored.</li>
        <li>When the property is too large to be placed in a temporary property locker, the item may be temporarily stored in any department supply room or other location that can be secured from unauthorized entry. The location shall be secured to prevent
            entry and a completed property form placed into a numbered property locker indicating the location of the property.</li>

            area until a property and evidence technician can log the property.</li>
        <li>All currency shall be counted in the presence of another officer and the money envelope initialed by both officers. A supervisor shall be contacted for cash in excess of $250. The supervisor shall also witness the count, and will initial and date

                <li>MTPD may serve the court order either by assignment or when an officer comes into contact with an abusing party or defendant for which a court order has been issued but has not been served, or for which they are in violation. In such cases,
                    if there are firearms that may be lawfully seized, they should be seized and submitted to the Property and Evidence pursuant to standard protocol.</li>

    <h2>808 - Restoration of Firearm Serial Numbers</h2>
    <h3>808.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>The primary purpose for restoring firearm serial numbers is to determine the prior owners or origin of the item from which the number has been recovered. Thus, property can be returned to rightful owners or investigations can be initiated to curb
        illegal trade of contraband firearms. The purpose of this policy is to develop standards, methodologies and safety protocols for the recovery of obliterated serial numbers from firearms and other objects using procedures that are accepted as industry
        standards in the forensic community. All personnel who are involved in the restoration of serial numbers will observe the following guidelines.</p>

    <h3>808.2 PROCEDURE</h3>
    <p>Any firearm coming into the possession of the Metro Transit Police Department as evidence and found property, where the serial numbers have been removed or obliterated, will be processed in the following manner:</p>
    <h4>808.2.1 PRELIMINARY FIREARM EXAMINATION</h4>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Always keep the muzzle pointed in a safe direction. Be sure the firearm is in an unloaded condition. This includes removal of the ammunition source (e.g., the detachable magazine, contents of the tabular magazine) as well as the chamber contents.</li>
        <li>If the firearm is corroded shut or in a condition that would preclude inspection of the chamber contents, treat the firearm as if it is loaded. Make immediate arrangements for a firearms examiner or other qualified examiner to render the firearm
            safe.</li>
        <li>Accurately document the condition of the gun when received. Note the positions and conditions of the various components, such as the safeties, cylinder, magazine, slide and hammer. Accurately record/document cylinder chamber and magazine contents.
            Package the ammunition separately.</li>
        <li>If the firearm is to be processed for fingerprints or trace evidence, it should be processed before the serial number restoration is attempted. First record/document important aspects, such as halos on the revolver cylinder face or other relevant
            evidence that might be obscured by the fingerprinting chemicals.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>808.2.2 PROPERTY BOOKING PROCEDURE</h4>
    <p>Any employee taking possession of a firearm with removed or obliterated serial numbers shall book the firearm into property following standard procedures. The employee booking the firearm shall indicate on the property form that serial numbers have
        been removed or obliterated.</p>
    <h4>808.2.3 OFFICER RESPONSIBILITIES</h4>
    <p>The property and evidence technician receiving a firearm when the serial numbers have been removed or obliterated shall arrange for the firearm to be transported to the crime laboratory for restoration.</p>
    <p>Metro Transit Police Department</p>
    <h4>808.2.4 DOCUMENTATION</h4>
    <p>Case reports should be prepared in order to document the chain of custody and the initial examination and handling of evidence from the time it is received or collected until it is released.</p>
    <p>This report must include a record of the manner in which and/or from whom the firearm was received. This may appear on the request form or property form depending on the type of evidence.</p>
    <h4>808.2.5 FIREARM TRACE</h4>
    <p>After the serial number has been restored (or partially restored) by the crime laboratory, a Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives (ATF) National Tracing Center (NTC) trace request form will be completed and submitted to the NTC.</p>

    <h3>808.3 OTHER CONSIDERATIONS</h3>
    <p>Exemplar bullets and cartridge cases from the firearm, depending upon acceptance criteria and protocol, may be submitted to the ATF's National Integrated Ballistic Information Network (NIBIN), which uses the Integrated Ballistic Identification System
        (IBIS) technology to search the national database and compare with ballistic evidence recovered from other crime scenes.</p>

    <h2>814 - Computers and Digital Evidence</h2>
    <h3>814.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>This policy establishes procedures for the seizure and storage of computers, personal communications devices (PCDs) digital cameras, digital recorders and other electronic devices that are capable of storing digital information; and for the preservation
        and storage of digital evidence. All evidence seized and/or processed pursuant to this policy shall be done so in compliance with clearly established Fourth Amendment and search and seizure provisions.</p>

    <h3>814.2 SEIZING COMPUTERS AND RELATED EVIDENCE</h3>
    <p>Computer equipment requires specialized training and handling to preserve its value as evidence. Officers should be aware of the potential to destroy information through careless or improper handling, and utilize the most knowledgeable available resources.
        When seizing a computer and accessories the following steps should be taken:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Photograph each item, front, back and surrounding desktop or office setup, specifically including cable connections to other items. Look for a telephone line or cable to a modem for Internet access.</li>
        <li>Do not overlook the possibility of the presence of physical evidence on and around the hardware relevant to the particular investigation such as fingerprints, biological or trace evidence and/or documents.</li>
        <li>If the computer is off, do not turn it on.</li>
        <li>If the computer is on, do not shut it down normally and do not click on anything or examine any files.
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>Photograph the screen, if possible, and note any programs or windows that appear to be open and running.</li>
                <li>Disconnect the power cable from the back of the computer box or if a portable notebook style, disconnect any power cable from the case and remove the battery.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Label each item with case number, evidence sheet number and item number.</li>
        <li>Handle and transport the computer and storage media (e.g., tape, discs, memory cards, flash memory, external drives) with care so that potential evidence is not lost.</li>
        <li>Lodge all computer items into the Property and Evidence. Do not store computers where normal room temperature and humidity is not maintained.</li>
        <li>At minimum, officers should document the following in related reports:
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>Where the computer was located and whether it was in operation.</li>
                <li>Who was using it at the time.</li>
                <li>Who claimed ownership.</li>
                <li>If it can be determined, how it was being used.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>In most cases when a computer is involved in criminal acts and is in the possession of the suspect, the computer itself and all storage devices (e.g., printers, remote drives, hard drives, tape drives and disk drives) should be seized along with
            all media.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>814.2.1 BUSINESS OR NETWORKED COMPUTERS</h4>
    <p>If the computer belongs to a business or is part of a network, it may not be feasible to seize the entire computer. Cases involving networks require specialized handling. Officers should contact a certified forensic computer examiner for instructions
        or a response to the scene. It may be possible to perform an on-site inspection, or to image the hard drive only of the involved computer. This should be done by someone specifically trained in processing computers for evidence.</p>
    <h4>814.2.2 FORENSIC EXAMINATION OF COMPUTERS</h4>
    <p>If an examination of the contents of the computer's hard drive, floppy disks, compact discs or any other storage media is required, forward the following items to a computer forensic examiner:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Copy of report(s) involving the computer, including the Evidence/Property sheet.</li>
        <li>Copy of a consent to search form signed by the computer owner or the person in possession of the computer, or a copy of a search warrant authorizing the search of the computer hard drive for evidence relating to investigation or other legal authority
            for examination.</li>
        <li>A listing of the items to search for (e.g., photographs, financial records, E-mail, documents).</li>
        <li>A forensic copy of the media will be made, and subsequent forensic examination of the copy will be conducted by a trained digital forensic examiner.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>814.3 SEIZING DIGITAL STORAGE MEDIA</h3>
    <p>Digital storage media including hard drives, floppy discs, CDs, DVDs, tapes, memory cards or flash memory devices should be seized and stored in a manner that will protect them from damage.</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>If the media has a write-protection tab or switch, it should be activated.</li>
        <li>Do not review, access or open digital files prior to submission. If the information is needed for immediate investigation request the Property and Evidence to copy the contents to an appropriate form of storage media.</li>
        <li>Many kinds of storage media can be erased or damaged by magnetic fields. Keep all media away from magnetic devices, electric motors, radio transmitters or other sources of magnetic fields.</li>
        <li>Do not leave storage media where they would be subject to excessive heat such as in a parked vehicle on a hot day.</li>
        <li>Use plastic cases designed to protect the media, or other protective packaging, to prevent damage.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>814.4 SEIZING PCDS</h3>
    <p>Personal communication devices such as cellular telephones, PDAs or other hand-held devices connected to any communication network must be handled with care to preserve evidence that may be on the device including messages, stored data and/or images.</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Officers should not attempt to access, review or search the contents of such devices prior to examination by a forensic expert. Unsent messages can be lost, data can be inadvertently deleted and incoming messages can override stored messages.</li>
        <li>Do not turn the device on or off. The device should be placed in a solid metal container such as a paint can or in a Faraday bag, to prevent the device from sending or receiving information from its host network.</li>
        <li>When seizing the devices, also seize the charging units and keep them plugged in to the chargers until they can be examined. If the batteries go dead all the data may be lost.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>814.5 DIGITAL EVIDENCE RECORDED BY OFFICERS</h3>
    <p>Officers handling and submitting recorded and digitally stored evidence from digital cameras and audio or video recorders will comply with these procedures to ensure the integrity and admissibility of such evidence.</p>
    <h4>814.5.1 COLLECTION OF DIGITAL EVIDENCE</h4>
    <p>Once evidence is recorded it shall not be erased, deleted or altered in any way prior to submission. All photographs taken will be preserved regardless of quality, composition or relevance. Video and audio files will not be altered in any way.</p>
    <h4>814.5.2 SUBMISSION OF DIGITAL MEDIA</h4>
    <p>The following are required procedures for the submission of digital media used by cameras or other recorders:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>The recording media (e.g., smart card, compact flash card or any other media) shall be brought to the Property and Evidence Unit as soon as reasonably possible for submission into evidence.</li>
        <li>Officers are not authorized to review or copy memory cards. The evidence technicians are the only employees authorized to copy and/or distribute digital media made from the memory cards.</li>
        <li>As soon as reasonably possible following the collection of evidence, the camera operator is to remove the memory card from his/her digital camera and place the card into a plastic carrier (if available). The camera operator shall write their name,
            related case number and any additional requested information on the Evidence Photo Log Form before placing the card into the drop locker along with the evidence form.</li>
        <li>Evidence technicians will make a copy of the memory card using appropriate storage media. Once they have verified that the images properly transferred to the storage media, the</p> technicians will erase the memory card for reuse. The storage
            media will be marked as the original.</li>
        <li>Officers requiring a copy of the digital files must request a copy on the evidence form when submitted to evidence.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>814.5.3 DOWNLOADING OF DIGITAL FILES</h4>
    <p>Digital information such as video or audio files recorded on devices using internal memory must be downloaded to storage media. The following procedures are to be followed:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Files should not be opened or reviewed prior to downloading and storage.</li>
        <li>Where reasonably possible, the device should be connected to a computer and the files accessed directly from the computer directory or downloaded to a folder on the host computer for copying to the storage media.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>814.5.4 PRESERVATION OF DIGITAL EVIDENCE</h4>
    <p>Only evidence technicians are authorized to copy original digital media related to case documentation that is held as evidence. Only digital forensic examiners are authorized to copy original media seized as evidence. The original digital media shall
        remain in evidence and shall remain unaltered.</p>
    <p>Digital images that are enhanced to provide a better quality photograph for identification and investigative purposes must only be made from a copy of the original media.</p>
    <p>If any enhancement is done to the copy of the original, it shall be noted in the corresponding incident report.</p>

            changing clothes, urinating, defecating, smoking, drinking or eating.</li>
        <li>If the abuse occurred within a time period that still allows for the collection of physical evidence, ensure that the alleged abuser does not take any actions that could destroy</li>

        retirement board of one of the several branches of the armed forces, that is existing at the time preference is claimed.</p>
    <p>For purposes of the preference to be used in securing appointment from a competitive promotional examination, "disabled veteran" means a person who, at the time of election to use a promotional preference, is entitled to disability compensation under
        laws administered by the Veterans Administration for a permanent service-connected disability rated at 50 percent or more.</p>
    <p><strong>Preference for Spouses</strong> - A preference available pursuant to Minn. Stat. § 197.455 may be used by the surviving spouse of a deceased veteran and by the spouse of a disabled veteran who, because of the disability, is unable to qualify.</p>
    <p><strong>Ranking of Veterans</strong> - An eligible applicant with a rating augmented by veteran's preference shall be entered on an eligible list ahead of a non-veteran with the same rating. When notifying eligible applicants that they have passed
        examinations this department shall show the final examination ratings and preference credits and shall notify eligible applicants that they may elect to use veteran's preference to augment passing ratings.</p>

    <h2>1002 - Evaluation of Employees</h2>
    <h3>1002.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>The Department's employee performance evaluation system is designed to record work performance for both the Department and the employee, providing recognition for good work and developing a guide for improvement.</p>

    <h3>1002.2 POLICY</h3>
    <p>The Metro Transit Police Department utilizes a performance evaluation report to measure performance and to use as a factor in making personnel decisions that relate to promotion, reassignment, discipline, demotion and termination. The evaluation report
        is intended to serve as a guide for work planning and review by the supervisor and employee. It gives supervisors a way to create an objective history of work performance based on job standards.</p>
    <p>The Department evaluates employees in a non-discriminatory manner based upon job-related factors specific to the employee's position, without regard to sex, race, color, national origin, religion, age, disability or other protected classes.</p>

    <h3>1002.3 EVALUATION PROCESS</h3>
    <p>Evaluation reports will cover a specific period of time and should be based on documented performance during that period. Evaluation reports will be completed by each employee's immediate supervisor. Other supervisors directly familiar with the employee's
        performance during the rating period should be consulted by the immediate supervisor for their input.</p>
    <p>Each supervisor should discuss the tasks of the position, standards of performance expected and the evaluation criteria with each employee at the beginning of the rating period. Supervisors should document this discussion in the prescribed manner.</p>
    <p>Assessment of an employee's job performance is an ongoing process. Continued coaching and feedback provides supervisors and employees with opportunities to correct performance issues as they arise.</p>
    <p>Non-probationary employees demonstrating substandard performance shall be notified in writing of such performance as soon as possible in order to have an opportunity to remediate the issues. Such notification should occur at the earliest opportunity,
        with the goal being a minimum of 90 days written notice prior to the end of the evaluation period.</p>
    <p>Employees who disagree with their evaluation and who desire to provide a formal response or a rebuttal, may do so in writing in the prescribed format and time period.</p>

    <h3>1002.4 EVALUATION FREQUENCY</h3>
    <p>Employees are evaluated based on the following guidelines unless their collective bargaining agreement states otherwise:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Full-time / Part-time non-represented:
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>Evaluated in months three and five during their six month probation.</li>
                <li>Evaluated yearly upon completion of probation.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Full-time licensed officers:
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>Evaluated daily, weekly and monthly during field training and while on probation.</li>
                <li>Evaluated yearly upon completion of probation.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Part-time licensed officers:</p>
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>Evaluated daily, weekly and monthly during their first 100 hours of shift work.</li>
                <li>Evaluated yearly upon completion of probation.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>1002.4.1 PART-TIME OFFICER EVALUATIONS</h4>
    <p>Part-time officer evaluations are conducted by supervisors with knowledge of the employees performance during the rating period. This will often be completed by a committee of supervisors based on the sporadic schedules worked by many of the part-time
        officers.</p>

    <h3>1002.5 FULL-TIME PROBATIONARY PERSONNEL</h3>
    <p>Personnel must successfully complete the probationary period before being eligible for certification as regular employees. An evaluation will be completed at months three and five for all full-time non- licensed personnel during the probationary period.
        Probationary licensed personnel are evaluated daily, weekly and monthly during the probationary period.</p>

    <h3>1002.6 FULL-TIME LICENSED REGULAR STATUS PERSONNEL</h3>
    <p>Regular employees are subject to three types of performance evaluations:</p>
    <p><strong>Regular</strong> - An Employee Performance Evaluation shall be completed once each year by the employee's immediate supervisor.</p>
    <p><strong>Transfer</strong> - If an employee is transferred from one assignment to another in the middle of an evaluation period and less than six months have transpired since the transfer, an evaluation shall be completed by the current supervisor
        with input from the previous supervisor.</p>
    <p><strong>Special</strong> - A special evaluation may be completed any time the rater or the rater's supervisor determine one is necessary due to employee performance that is deemed less than standard. Generally, the special evaluation will be the tool
        used to demonstrate those areas of performance deemed less than standard when follow-up action is planned (e.g., action plan, remedial training, retraining). The evaluation form and the attached documentation shall be submitted as one package.</p>
    <h4>1002.6.1 RATINGS</h4>
    <p>When completing the Employee Performance Evaluation for licensed personnel, the rater will select the category that best describes the employee's performance. The definition of each rating category is as follows:</p>
    <p><strong>Outstanding</strong> - Actual performance that is well beyond that required for the position. It is exceptional performance, definitely superior or extraordinary.</p>
    <p><strong>Exceeds Standards</strong> - Represents performance that is better than expected of a fully competent employee. It is superior to what is expected but is not of such rare nature to warrant outstanding.</p>
    <p><strong>Meets Standards</strong> - Performance of a fully competent employee. It means satisfactory performance that meets the standards required of the position.</p>
    <p><strong>Needs Improvement</strong> -A level of performance less than that expected of a fully competent employee and less than the standards required of the position. A needs-improvement rating must be thoroughly discussed with the employee.</p>
    <p><strong>Unsatisfactory</strong> - Performance is inferior to the standards required of the position. It is very inadequate or undesirable performance that cannot be tolerated.</p>
    <p>Space for written comments is provided at the end of the evaluation in the rater comments section. This section allows the rater to document the employee's strengths, weaknesses and suggestions for improvement. Any rating under any job dimension marked
        unsatisfactory, needs improvement or outstanding shall be substantiated in the rater comments section. Supervisors are required to add comments to each evaluation they complete regardless of the rating category selected.</p>
    <p>Non-represented employees are reviewed on Metropolitan Council evaluation forms that contain similar rating categories.</p>

    <h3>1002.7 EVALUATION INTERVIEW</h3>
    <p>When the supervisor has completed the preliminary evaluation, arrangements shall be made for a private discussion of the evaluation with the employee. The employee is encouraged to provide the supervisor with a self-evaluation using the same performance
        evaluation report. The supervisor should discuss the results of the recently completed rating period and clarify any questions the employee may have.</p>
    <p>If the employee has valid and reasonable protests of any of the ratings, the supervisor may make appropriate changes to the evaluation. Areas needing improvement and goals for reaching the expected level of performance should be identified and discussed.
        The supervisor should also provide relevant counseling regarding advancement, specialty positions and training opportunities. The supervisor and employee will sign and date the evaluation. Employees may also write comments in the employee comments
        section of the performance evaluation report.</p>

    <h3>1002.8 EVALUATION REVIEW</h3>
    <p>Officers will typically be reviewed by Sergeants. Those evaluations are then forwarded to the Shift Supervisor and ultimately to the Division Supervisor. The Division Supervisor shall review the evaluation for fairness, impartiality, uniformity and
        consistency.</p>
    <p>Sergeants will typically be reviewed by Lieutenants. Those evaluations are then forwarded to the Division Supervisor where the evaluations are reviewed for fairness, impartiality, uniformity and consistency. The evaluation is then forwarded to the
        Chief of Police or their designee for review.</p>
    <p>Lieutenants will typically be reviewed by a Division Supervisor. Those evaluations are then forwarded to the Chief of Police or their designee where they are reviewed for fairness, impartiality, uniformity and consistency.</p>

    <h3>1002.9 EVALUATION DISTRIBUTION</h3>
    <p>The original performance evaluation for licensed personnel shall be maintained in the employee's personnel file in the office of the Chief of Police for the tenure of the employee's employment. A copy will also be given to the employee. The original
        performance evaluation for non-represented personnel shall be maintained in the employee's personnel file in the office of the Chief of Police for the tenure of the employee's employment. A copy will also be given to the employee as well as provided

    <h2>1008 - Anti-Retaliation</h2>
    <h3>1008.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>This policy prohibits retaliation against members who identify workplace issues, such as fraud, waste, abuse of authority, gross mismanagement or any inappropriate conduct or practices, including violations that may pose a threat to the health, safety
        or well-being of members.</p>
    <p>This policy does not prohibit actions taken for nondiscriminatory or non-retaliatory reasons, such as discipline for cause.</p>
    <p>These guidelines are intended to supplement and not limit members’ access to other applicable remedies. Nothing in this policy shall diminish the rights or remedies of a member pursuant to any applicable federal law, provision of the U.S. Constitution,
        law, ordinance or collective bargaining agreement.</p>

    <h3>1008.2 POLICY</h3>
    <p>The Metro Transit Police Department has a zero tolerance for retaliation and is committed to taking reasonable steps to protect from retaliation members who, in good faith, engage in permitted behavior or who report or participate in the reporting
        or investigation of workplace issues. All complaints of retaliation will be taken seriously and will be promptly and appropriately investigated.</p>

    <h3>1008.3 RETALIATION PROHIBITED</h3>
    <p>No member may retaliate against any person for engaging in lawful or otherwise permitted behavior; for opposing a practice believed to be unlawful, unethical, discriminatory or retaliatory; for reporting or making a complaint under this policy; or
        for participating in any investigation related to a complaint under this or any other policy.</p>

        time (41 USC § 8103). The lawful possession or use of prescribed medications or over-the-counter remedies is excluded from this prohibition.</p>
    <p>Members who are authorized to consume alcohol as part of a special assignment shall not do so to the extent of impairing on-duty performance.</p>
    <p>Members shall notify a supervisor immediately if they observe behavior or other evidence that they believe demonstrates that a fellow member poses a risk to the health and safety of the member or others due to drug or alcohol use.</p>
    <p>Members are required to notify their immediate supervisors of any criminal drug statute conviction for a violation occurring in the workplace no later than five days after such conviction (41 USC § 8103).</p>

    <h3>1012.5 EMPLOYEE ASSISTANCE PROGRAM</h3>
    <p>There may be available a voluntary employee assistance program to assist those who wish to seek help for alcohol and drug problems (41 USC § 8103). Insurance coverage that provides treatment for drug and alcohol abuse also may be available. Employees
        should contact the Department of Human Resources, their insurance providers or the employee assistance program for additional information. It is the responsibility of each employee to seek assistance before alcohol or drug problems lead to performance
        problems.</p>

    <h3>1012.6 WORK RESTRICTIONS</h3>
    <p>If a member informs a supervisor that he/she has consumed any alcohol, drug or medication that could interfere with a safe and efficient job performance, the member may be required to obtain clearance from his/her physician before continuing to work.</p>
    <p>If the supervisor reasonably believes, based on objective facts, that a member is impaired by the consumption of alcohol or other drugs, the supervisor shall prevent the member from continuing work and shall ensure that he/she is safely transported
        away from the Department.</p>

    <h3>1012.7 REQUESTING SCREENING TESTS</h3>
    <p>The Department may request or require drug or alcohol testing in the following circumstances (Minn. Stat. § 181.951; Minn. Stat. § 181.952):</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li><strong>Reasonable suspicion</strong> - The Shift Supervisor may request or require an employee to undergo drug and alcohol testing if there is a reasonable suspicion of any of the following:

                <li>The employee has sustained an injury arising out of and in the course of employment, or has caused another employee to sustain an injury (full definition of personal injury in Minn. Stat. § 176.011, Subd. 16).</li>
                <li>The employee has caused a work-related accident, or his/her use of a vehicle, firearm or safety equipment involved a work-related accident.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Following a conditional job offer</li>
        <li>As part of an employee’s routine physical examination</li>
        <li>Under a random testing program of employees</li>
        <li>When the employee has been referred for an evaluation or treatment, or is participating in a treatment program under an employee benefit plan</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>1012.7.1 DRUG- AND ALCOHOL-TESTING PROGRAM</h4>
    <p>The following applies to the department’s drug and alcohol testing procedures (Minn. Stat. § 181.951; Minn. Stat. § 181.952; Minn. Stat. § 181.953):</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>An employee or applicant has the right to refuse a test but the consequences of a refusal may result in discipline, up to and including termination, or a decision not to hire the applicant.</li>
        <li>Initial screening tests must be verified by a confirmatory test for the purpose of discipline.</li>
        <li>Employees will have an opportunity to participate in an appropriate alcohol or drug program for their first confirmed positive test. The program may be in lieu of other discipline unless the employee fails the program or refuses to participate.</li>
        <li>A confirmed positive test may result in discipline, up to and including termination.</li>
        <li>An employee or job applicant will have the opportunity to explain a positive test result and may request and pay for a second confirmatory retest.</li>
        <li>All disciplinary procedural safeguards in this manual apply, including the post-discipline appeal procedures (see the Personnel Complaints Policy).</li>
        <li>Employees and job applicants shall receive required written notice, including posting, of the drug- and alcohol-testing policies and procedures as set forth in Minn. Stat. § 181.952.</li>
        <li>The safeguards of Minn. Stat. § 181.953 will be followed for any testing and any related discipline process.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>1012.8 COMPLIANCE WITH THE DRUG-FREE WORKPLACE ACT</h3>
    <p>No later than 30 days following notice of any drug statute conviction for a violation occurring in the workplace involving a member, the Department will take appropriate disciplinary action, up to and including dismissal, and/or requiring the member

        or pursuant to lawful process.</p>
    <p>The written results of any screening tests and all documents generated by the employee assistance program are considered confidential medical records and shall be maintained separately from the employee’s other personnel files.</p>
</div>
            <div class="chapter" id="1014">
    <h2>1014 - Annual Leave</h2>
    <h3>1014.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>Employees of this department are provided with an annual leave benefit that gives them continued compensation during times of absence due to personal leave, illness etc. The number of hours available is detailed in the employee's respective personnel
        manual or applicable collective bargaining agreement. Employees may also be entitled to additional paid or unpaid leave for certain family and medical reasons as provided for in the Family and Medical Leave Act (FMLA) (29 CFR 825.100).</p>

    <h3>1014.2 EMPLOYEE RESPONSIBILITIES</h3>
    <p>Annual leave may be used for scheduled/approved absences. Abuse of annual leave may result in discipline and/or denial of annual leave benefits.</p>
    <h4>1014.2.1 NOTIFICATION</h4>
    <p>Employees are encouraged to notify an immediate supervisor, the Shift Supervisor or other appropriate supervisor as soon as they are aware that they will not be able to report to work. At a minimum, employees shall make such notification no less than
        the amount of time specified in their collective bargaining agreement before the start of their scheduled shift. If an employee is unable to contact the supervisor in the case of an emergency, every reasonable effort should be made to have a representative
        contact the supervisor.</p>
    <p>When the necessity for leave is foreseeable, the employee shall, whenever reasonably possible, provide notice to the Department as soon as reasonably possible of the intent to take leave.</p>

    <h3>1014.3 EAVE DUE TO ILLNESS</h3>
    <p>Employees on extended absences shall, if possible, contact their unit supervisor at three-day intervals to provide an update on their absence and expected date of return. Employees absent from duty due to personal illness in excess of three consecutive
        days may be required to furnish a statement from their health care provider supporting the use of annual leave and/or the ability to return to work.</p>
    <p>Nothing in this section precludes a supervisor, based upon reasonable cause, from requiring a physician's statement if three or fewer annual leave days are taken for an illness.</p>

    <h3>1014.4 SUPERVISOR RESPONSIBILITIES</h3>
    <p>Supervisors should monitor annual leave usage and regularly review the attendance of employees under their command to ensure that the use of annual leave is consistent with this policy. Supervisors should address annual leave use in the employee's
        performance evaluation when it has negatively affected the employee's performance or ability to complete assigned duties and when unusual amounts of annual leave by the employee have a negative impact on department operations. When appropriate,
        supervisors should counsel employees regarding the excessive use of annual leave and should consider referring the employee to the Employee Assistance Program.</p>

            <div class="chapter" id="1016">
    <h2>1016 - Communicable Diseases</h2>
    <h3>1016.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>This policy provides general guidelines to assist in minimizing the risk of department members contracting and/or spreading communicable diseases.</p>
    <h4>1016.1.1 DEFINITIONS</h4>
    <p>Definitions related to this policy include:</p>
    <p><strong>Communicable disease</strong> - A human disease caused by microorganisms that are present in and transmissible through human blood, bodily fluid, tissue, or by breathing or coughing. These diseases commonly include, but are not limited to,
        hepatitis B virus (HBV), HIV and tuberculosis.</p>
    <p><strong>Exposure</strong> - When an eye, mouth, mucous membrane or non-intact skin comes into contact with blood or other potentially infectious materials, or when these substances are injected or infused under the skin; when an individual is exposed
        to a person who has a disease that can be passed through the air by talking, sneezing or coughing (e.g., tuberculosis), or the individual is in an area that was occupied by such a person. Exposure only includes those instances that occur due to
        a member’s position at the Metro Transit Police Department. (See the exposure control plan for further details to assist in identifying whether an exposure has occurred.)</p>

    <h3>1016.2 POLICY</h3>
    <p>The Metro Transit Police Department is committed to providing a safe work environment for its members. Members should be aware that they are ultimately responsible for their own health and safety.</p>

    <h3>1016.3 EXPOSURE CONTROL OFFICER</h3>
    <p>The Chief of Police will assign a person as the Exposure Control Officer (ECO). The ECO shall develop an exposure control plan that includes:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Exposure-prevention and decontamination procedures.</li>
        <li>Procedures for when and how to obtain medical attention in the event of an exposure or suspected exposure.</li>
        <li>The provision that department members will have no-cost access to the appropriate personal protective equipment (PPE) (e.g., gloves, face masks, eye protection, pocket masks) for each member’s position and risk of exposure.</li>
        <li>Evaluation of persons in custody for any exposure risk and measures to separate them.</li>
        <li>Compliance with all relevant laws or regulations related to communicable diseases, including:
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>Responding to requests and notifications regarding exposures covered under the Ryan White law (42 USC § 300ff-133; 42 USC § 300ff-136).</li>
                <li>Exposure control mandates in 29 CFR 1910.1030 (Minn. R. 5206.0600).</li>
                <li>Reporting cases and suspected cases of communicable diseases to the Department of Public Health (Minn. R. 4605.7070; Minn. Stat. § 144.4804).</li>
                <li>Notifying appropriate medical facilities regarding member exposures and providing assistance locating source individuals, as applicable (Minn. Stat. § 144.7414)</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>The ECO should also act as the liaison with the Minnesota Occupational Safety and Health Administration (MNOSHA) and may request voluntary compliance inspections. The ECO should annually review and update the exposure control plan and review implementation
        of the plan.</p>

    <h3>1016.4 EXPOSURE PREVENTION AND MITIGATION</h3>
    <h4>1016.4.1 GENERAL PRECAUTIONS</h4>
    <p>All members are expected to use good judgment and follow training and procedures related to mitigating the risks associated with communicable disease. This includes, but is not limited to (29 CFR 1910.1030; Minn. R. 5206.0600):</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Stocking disposable gloves, antiseptic hand cleanser, CPR masks or other specialized equipment in the work area or department vehicles, as applicable.</li>
        <li>Wearing department-approved disposable gloves when contact with blood, other potentially infectious materials, mucous membranes and non-intact skin can be reasonably anticipated.</li>
        <li>Washing hands immediately or as soon as feasible after removal of gloves or other PPE.</li>
        <li>Treating all human blood and bodily fluids/tissue as if it is known to be infectious for a communicable disease.</li>
        <li>Using an appropriate barrier device when providing CPR.</li>
        <li>Using a face mask or shield if it is reasonable to anticipate an exposure to an airborne transmissible disease.</li>
        <li>Decontaminating non-disposable equipment (e.g., flashlight, control devices, clothing and portable radio) as soon as possible if the equipment is a potential source of exposure.
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>Clothing that has been contaminated by blood or other potentially infectious materials shall be removed immediately or as soon as feasible and stored/decontaminated appropriately.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Handling all sharps and items that cut or puncture (e.g., needles, broken glass, razors, knives) cautiously and using puncture-resistant containers for their storage and/or transportation.</li>
        <li>Avoiding eating, drinking, smoking, applying cosmetics or lip balm, or handling contact lenses where there is a reasonable likelihood of exposure.</li>
        <li>Disposing of biohazardous waste appropriately or labeling biohazardous material properly when it is stored.</li>
    </ol>
    <h3>1016.4.2 IMMUNIZATIONS</h4>
										                    <p>Members who could be exposed to HBV due to their positions may receive the HBV vaccine and any routine booster at no cost (29 CFR 1910.1030; Minn. R. 5206.0600).</p>

												            <h3>1016.5 POST EXPOSURE</h3>
    <h4>1016.5.1 INITIAL POST-EXPOSURE STEPS</h4>
    <p>Members who experience an exposure or suspected exposure shall:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Begin decontamination procedures immediately (e.g., wash hands and any other skin with soap and water, flush mucous membranes with water).</li>
        <li>Obtain medical attention as appropriate.</li>
        <li>Notify a supervisor as soon as practicable.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>1016.5.2 REPORTING REQUIREMENTS</h4>
    <p>The supervisor on-duty shall investigate every exposure or suspected exposure that occurs as soon as possible following the incident. The supervisor shall ensure the following information is documented (29 CFR 1910.1030; Minn. R. 5206.0600):</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Name and Social Security number of the member exposed</li>
        <li>Date and time of the incident</li>
        <li>Location of the incident</li>
        <li>Potentially infectious materials involved and the source of exposure (e.g., identification of the person who may have been the source)</li>
        <li>Work being done during exposure</li>
        <li>How the incident occurred or was caused</li>
        <li>PPE in use at the time of the incident</li>
        <li>Actions taken post-event (e.g., clean-up, notifications)</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The supervisor shall advise the member that disclosing the identity and/or infectious status of a source to the public or to anyone who is not involved in the follow-up process is prohibited. The supervisor should complete the incident documentation
        in conjunction with other reporting requirements that may apply (see the Occupational Disease, Personal Injury and Death Reporting Policy).</p>
    <h4>1016.5.3 MEDICAL CONSULTATION, EVALUATION AND TREATMENT</h4>
    <p>Department members shall have the opportunity to have a confidential medical evaluation immediately after an exposure and follow-up evaluations as necessary.</p>
    <p>The ECO should request a written opinion/evaluation from the treating medical professional that contains only the following information (29 CFR 1910.1030; Minn. R. 5206.0600):</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Whether the member has been informed of the results of the evaluation.</li>
        <li>Whether the member has been notified of any medical conditions resulting from exposure to blood or other potentially infectious materials which require further evaluation or treatment.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>No other information should be requested or accepted by the ECO.</p>
    <h4>1016.5.4 COUNSELING</h4>
    <p>The Department shall provide the member, and his/her family if necessary, the opportunity for counseling and consultation regarding the exposure (29 CFR 1910.1030; Minn. R. 5206.0600).</p>
    <h4>1016.5.5 SOURCE TESTING</h4>
    <p>Testing a person for communicable diseases when that person was the source of an exposure should be done when it is desired by the exposed member or when it is otherwise appropriate. Source testing is the responsibility of the ECO. If the ECO is unavailable
        to seek timely testing of the source, it is the responsibility of the exposed member’s supervisor to ensure testing is sought.</p>
    <p>Source testing may be achieved by:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Obtaining consent from the individual.</li>
        <li>Seeking testing through the procedures of Minn. Stat. § 144.7401 to Minn. Stat. § 144.7415 through a licensed hospital or other emergency medical care facility.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Since there is the potential for overlap between the different manners in which source testing may occur, the ECO is responsible for coordinating the testing to prevent unnecessary or duplicate testing.</p>
    <p>The ECO should seek the consent of the individual for testing and consult the Prosecuting Attorney to discuss other options when no statute exists for compelling the source of an exposure to undergo testing if he/she refuses.</p>

    <h3>1016.6 CONFIDENTIALITY OF REPORTS</h3>
    <p>Medical information shall remain in confidential files and shall not be disclosed to anyone without the member’s written consent (except as required by law). Test results from persons who may have been the source of an exposure are to be kept confidential
        as well (Minn. Stat. § 144.7411).</p>

    <h3>1016.7 TRAINING</h3>
    <p>All members shall participate in training regarding communicable diseases commensurate with the requirements of their position. The training (29 CFR 1910.1030; Minn. R. 5206.0700):</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Shall be provided at the time of initial assignment to tasks where an occupational exposure may take place and at least annually after the initial training.</li>
        <li>Shall be provided whenever the member is assigned new tasks or procedures affecting his/ her potential exposure to communicable disease.</li>
        <li>Should provide guidance on what constitutes an exposure, what steps can be taken to avoid an exposure and what steps should be taken if a suspected exposure occurs.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>1018 - Smoking and Tobacco Use</h2>
    <h3>1018.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>This policy establishes limitations on smoking and the use of tobacco products by members and others while on-duty or while in Metro Transit Police Department facilities or vehicles.</p>
    <p>For the purposes of this policy, smoking and tobacco use includes, but is not limited to, any tobacco product, such as cigarettes, cigars, pipe tobacco, snuff, tobacco pouches and chewing tobacco, as well as any device intended to simulate smoking,
        such as an electronic cigarette or personal vaporizer.</p>

    <h3>1018.2 POLICY</h3>
    <p>The Metro Transit Police Department recognizes that tobacco use is a health risk and can be offensive to others.</p>
    <p>Smoking and tobacco use also presents an unprofessional image for the Department and its members. Therefore smoking and tobacco use is prohibited by members and visitors in all department facilities, buildings and vehicles, and as is further outlined
        in this policy (Minn. Stat. § 144.414).</p>

    <h3>1018.3 SMOKING AND TOBACCO EMPLOYEE USE</h3>
    <p>Smoking and tobacco use by members is prohibited anytime members are in public view representing the Department.</p>
    <p>It shall be the responsibility of each member to ensure that no person under his/her supervision smokes or uses any tobacco product inside Metropolitan Council / Metro Transit facilities and vehicles.</p>

    <h3>1018.4 ADDITIONAL PROHIBITIONS</h3>
    <p>No employee shall smoke, even while out of view of the public or off-duty, in areas properly posted with "No Smoking" notices nor shall any employee use tobacco products on public school property (Minn. Stat. § 609.681; Minn. Stat. § 144.4165). The
        Chief of Police or the authorized designee should ensure that proper signage is in place for notice of areas where tobacco use is restricted (Minn. R. 4620.0500).</p>

    <h2>1020 - Personnel Complaints</h2>
    <h3>1020.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>This policy provides guidelines for the reporting, investigation and disposition of complaints regarding the conduct of members of the Metro Transit Police Department (Minn. R. 6700.2200). This policy shall not apply to any questioning, counseling,
        instruction, informal verbal admonishment or other routine or unplanned contact of a member in the normal course of duty, by a supervisor or any other member, nor shall this policy apply to a criminal investigation.</p>

    <h3>1020.2 POLICY</h3>
    <p>The Metro Transit Police Department takes seriously all complaints regarding the service provided by the Department and the conduct of its members.</p>
    <p>The Department will accept and address all complaints of misconduct in accordance with this policy and applicable federal, state and local law, municipal and county rules and the requirements of any memorandum of understanding.</p>
    <p>It is also the policy of this department to ensure that the community can report misconduct without concern for reprisal or retaliation.</p>

    <h3>1020.3 PERSONNEL COMPLAINTS</h3>
    <p>Personnel complaints include any allegation of misconduct or improper job performance that, if true, would constitute a violation of department policy or of federal, state or local law, policy or rule. Personnel complaints may be generated internally
        or by the public.</p>
    <p>Inquiries about conduct or performance that, if true, would not violate department policy or federal, state or local law, policy or rule may be handled informally by a supervisor and shall not be considered a personnel complaint. Such inquiries generally
        include clarification regarding policy, procedures or the response to specific incidents by the Department.</p>
    <h4>1020.3.1 COMPLAINT CLASSIFICATIONS</h4>
    <p>Personnel complaints shall be classified in one of the following categories:</p>
    <p><strong>Informal</strong> - A matter in which the Shift Supervisor is satisfied that appropriate action has been taken by a supervisor of rank greater than the accused member.</p>
    <p><strong>Formal</strong> - A matter in which a supervisor determines that further action is warranted. Such complaints may be investigated by a supervisor of rank greater than the accused member or referred to the Professional Standards Unit, depending
        on the seriousness and complexity of the investigation.</p>
    <p><strong>Incomplete</strong> - A matter in which the complaining party either refuses to cooperate or becomes unavailable after diligent follow-up investigation. At the discretion of the assigned supervisor or the Professional Standards Unit, such
        matters may be further investigated depending on the seriousness of the complaint and the availability of sufficient information.</p>
    <h4>1020.3.2 SOURCES OF COMPLAINTS</h4>
    <p>The following applies to the source of complaints:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Individuals from the public may make complaints in any form, including in writing, by email, in person or by telephone.</li>
        <li>Any department member becoming aware of alleged misconduct shall immediately notify a supervisor.</li>
        <li>Supervisors shall initiate a complaint based upon observed misconduct or receipt from any source alleging misconduct that, if true, could result in disciplinary action.</li>
        <li>Anonymous and third-party complaints should be accepted and investigated to the extent that sufficient information is provided.</li>
        <li>Tort claims and lawsuits may generate a personnel complaint.</li>
        <li>The Minnesota Board of Peace Officer Standards and Training (POST) may refer complaints alleging a violation of a statute or rule that the board is empowered to enforce (Minn. Stat. § 214.10, Subd. 10).</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>1020.4 AVAILABILITY AND ACCEPTANCE OF COMPLAINTS</h3>
    <h4>1020.4.1 COMPLAINT FORMS</h4>
    <p>Personnel complaint forms will be maintained in a clearly visible location in the public area of the police facility and be accessible through the department website.</p>
    <p>Personnel complaint forms in languages other than English may also be provided, as determined necessary or practicable.</p>
    <h4>1020.4.2 ACCEPTANCE</h4>
    <p>All complaints will be courteously accepted by any department member and promptly given to the appropriate supervisor. Although written complaints are preferred, a complaint may also be filed orally, either in person or by telephone. Such complaints
        will be directed to a supervisor. If a supervisor is not immediately available to take an oral complaint, the receiving member shall obtain contact information sufficient for the supervisor to contact the complainant. The supervisor, upon contact
        with the complainant, shall complete and submit a complaint form as appropriate.</p>
    <p>Although not required, complainants should be encouraged to file complaints in person so that proper identification, signatures, photographs or physical evidence may be obtained as necessary.</p>

    <h3>1020.5 DOCUMENTATION</h3>
    <p>Supervisors shall ensure that all formal and informal complaints are documented on a complaint form. The supervisor shall ensure that the nature of the complaint is defined as clearly as possible.</p>
    <p>All complaints and inquiries should also be documented in a log that records and tracks complaints. The log shall include the nature of the complaint and the actions taken to address the complaint. On an annual basis, the Department should audit the
        log and send an audit report to the Chief of Police or the authorized designee.</p>

    <h3>1020.6 ADMINISTRATIVE INVESTIGATIONS</h3>
    <p>Allegations of misconduct will be administratively investigated as follows (Minn. R. 6700.2200).</p>
    <h4>1020.6.1 SUPERVISOR RESPONSIBILITIES</h4>
    <p>In general, the primary responsibility for the investigation of a personnel complaint shall rest with the member's immediate supervisor, unless the supervisor is the complainant, or the supervisor is the ultimate decision-maker regarding disciplinary
        action or has any personal involvement regarding the alleged misconduct. The Chief of Police or the authorized designee may direct that another supervisor investigate any complaint.</p>
    <p>A supervisor who becomes aware of alleged misconduct shall take reasonable steps to prevent aggravation of the situation.</p>
    <p>The responsibilities of supervisors include, but are not limited to:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Ensuring that upon receiving or initiating any formal complaint, a complaint form is completed.
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>The original complaint form will be directed to the Shift Supervisor of the accused member, via the chain of command, who will take appropriate action and/or determine who will have responsibility for the investigation.</li>
                <li>In circumstances where the integrity of the investigation could be jeopardized by reducing the complaint to writing or where the confidentiality of a complainant is at issue, a supervisor shall orally report the matter to the member's
                    Captain or the Chief of Police, who will initiate appropriate action.</li>
            </ol>

    <h4>1020.6.2 ADMINISTRATIVE INVESTIGATION PROCEDURES</h4>
    <p>Whether conducted by a supervisor or an assigned member of the Professional Standards Unit, the following shall apply to employees covered by the Peace Officer Discipline Procedures Act (Minn. Stat. § 626.89):</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Interviews of an accused member shall be conducted during reasonable hours and preferably when the member is on-duty (Minn. Stat. § 626.89, Subd. 7). If the member is off-duty, he/she shall be compensated.</li>
        <li>Unless waived by the member, interviews of an accused member shall be at the Metro Transit Police Department or at a place agreed upon by the accused employee. An investigator may not interview an employee at that person’s home without the employee’s
            prior permission (Minn. Stat. § 626.89, Subd. 4).</li>
        <li>No more than two interviewers should ask questions of an accused member.</li>
        <li>Prior to any interview, a member should be informed of the nature of the investigation.
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>The member shall be given a copy of any written complaint signed by the complainant (Minn. Stat. § 626.89, Subd. 5).</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>All interviews should be for a reasonable period and the member's personal needs should be accommodated (Minn. Stat. § 626.89, Subd. 7).</li>
        <li>No member should be subjected to offensive or threatening language, nor shall any promises, rewards or other inducements be used to obtain answers. Any member refusing to answer questions directly related to the investigation may be ordered to
            answer questions administratively and may be subject to discipline for failing to do so.</li>
        <li>The interviewer shall record all interviews of members and witnesses. The member may also record the interview. A complete copy or transcript of the interview must be made available to the employee upon written request without charge or undue
            delay. If the employee has been previously interviewed, a copy of that recorded interview shall be provided to the member prior to any subsequent interview (Minn. Stat. § 626.89, Subd. 8).</li>
        <li>All members subjected to interviews that could result in discipline have the right to have an uninvolved representative or attorney present before or during the interview (Minn. Stat. § 626.89, Subd. 9). When a member requests a representative
            or attorney, no interview may be taken until a reasonable opportunity is provided for the member to obtain that person’s presence. However, in order to maintain the integrity of each individual’s statement, involved members shall not consult
            or meet with a representative or attorney collectively or in groups prior to being interviewed.</li>
        <li>All members shall provide complete and truthful responses to questions posed during interviews.</li>
        <li>No member may be compelled to submit to a polygraph examination, nor shall any refusal to submit to such examination be mentioned in any investigation.</li>
        <li>Before a formal statement is taken, the employee shall be advised in writing or on the record that admissions made may be used as evidence of misconduct or a basis for discipline (Minn. Stat. § 626.89, Subd. 10).</li>
        <li>A member may not be required to produce financial records (Minn. Stat. § 626.89, Subd. 11).</li>
        <li>A member’s photograph will not be released unless allowed by law (Minn. Stat. § 626.89, Subd. 12).</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>1020.6.3 ADMINISTRATIVE INVESTIGATION FORMAT</h4>
    <p>Formal investigations of personnel complaints shall be thorough, complete and essentially follow this format:</p>
    <p><strong>Introduction</strong> - Include the identity of the members, the identity of the assigned investigators, the initial date and source of the complaint.</p>
    <p><strong>Synopsis</strong> - Provide a brief summary of the facts giving rise to the investigation.</p>
    <p><strong>Summary</strong> - List the allegations separately, including applicable policy sections, with a brief summary of the evidence relevant to each allegation. A separate recommended finding should be provided for each allegation.</p>
    <p><strong>Evidence</strong> - Each allegation should be set forth with the details of the evidence applicable to each allegation provided, including comprehensive summaries of member and witness statements. Other evidence related to each allegation
        should also be detailed in this section.</p>
    <p><strong>Conclusion</strong> - A recommendation regarding further action or disposition should be provided.</p>
    <p><strong>Exhibits</strong> - A separate list of exhibits (e.g., recordings, photos, documents) should be attached to the report.</p>
    <h4>1020.6.4 DISPOSITIONS</h4>
    <p>Each personnel complaint shall be classified with one of the following dispositions:</p>
    <p><strong>Unfounded</strong> - When the investigation discloses that the alleged acts did not occur or did not involve department members. Complaints that are determined to be frivolous will fall within the classification of unfounded.</p>
    <p><strong>Exonerated</strong> - When the investigation discloses that the alleged act occurred but that the act was justified, lawful and/or proper.</p>
    <p><strong>Not sustained</strong> - When the investigation discloses that there is insufficient evidence to sustain the complaint or fully exonerate the member.</p>
    <p><strong>Sustained</strong> - When the investigation discloses sufficient evidence to establish that the act occurred and that it constituted misconduct.</p>
    <p>If an investigation discloses misconduct or improper job performance that was not alleged in the original complaint, the investigator shall take appropriate action with regard to any additional allegations.</p>
    <h4>1020.6.5 COMPLETION OF INVESTIGATIONS</h4>
    <p>Every investigator or supervisor assigned to investigate a personnel complaint or other alleged misconduct shall proceed with due diligence in an effort to complete the investigation within one year from the date of discovery by an individual authorized
        to initiate an investigation.</p>
    <p>Notice to the complaining party shall be provided as soon as practicable following final disposition and be consistent with the provisions of the Minnesota Government Data Practices Act (Minn. Stat. § 13.43 Subd. 2; Minn. R. 6700.2200).</p>

    <h3>1020.7 ADMINISTRATIVE SEARCHES</h3>
    <p>Assigned lockers, storage spaces and other areas, including desks, offices and vehicles, may be searched as part of an administrative investigation upon a reasonable suspicion of misconduct.</p>
    <p>Such areas may also be searched any time by a supervisor for non-investigative purposes, such as obtaining a needed report, radio or other document or equipment.</p>

    <h3>1020.8 ADMINISTRATIVE LEAVE</h3>
    <p>When a complaint of misconduct is of a serious nature, or when circumstances indicate that allowing the accused to continue to work would adversely affect the mission of the Department, the Chief of Police or the authorized designee may temporarily
        assign an accused employee to administrative leave. Any employee placed on administrative leave:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>May be required to relinquish any department badge, identification, assigned weapons and any other department equipment.</li>
        <li>Shall be required to continue to comply with all policies and lawful orders of a supervisor.</li>
        <li>May be temporarily reassigned to a different shift, generally a normal business-hours shift, during the investigation. The employee may be required to remain available for contact at all times during such shift, and will report as ordered.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>1020.9 CRIMINAL INVESTIGATION</h3>
    <p>Where a member is accused of potential criminal conduct, a separate supervisor or investigator shall be assigned to investigate the criminal allegations apart from any administrative investigation. Any separate administrative investigation may parallel
        a criminal investigation.</p>
    <p>The Chief of Police shall be notified as soon as practicable when a member is accused of criminal conduct. The Chief of Police may request a criminal investigation by an outside law enforcement agency.</p>
    <p>A member accused of criminal conduct shall be provided with all rights afforded to a civilian. The member should not be administratively ordered to provide any information in the criminal investigation.</p>
    <p>No information or evidence administratively coerced from a member may be provided to anyone involved in conducting the criminal investigation or to any prosecutor.</p>
    <p>The Metro Transit Police Department may release information concerning the arrest or detention of any member, including an officer, that has not led to a conviction. No disciplinary action should be taken until an independent administrative investigation
        is conducted.</p>

    <h3>1020.10 POST-ADMINISTRATIVE INVESTIGATION PROCEDURES</h3>
    <p>Upon completion of a formal investigation, an investigation report should be forwarded to the Chief of Police through the chain of command. Each level of command should review and include their comments in writing before forwarding the report. The
        Chief of Police may accept or modify any classification or recommendation for disciplinary action.</p>
    <h4>1020.10.1 CAPTAIN RESPONSIBILITIES</h4>
    <p>Upon receipt of any completed personnel investigation, the Captain of the involved member shall review the entire investigative file, the member's personnel file and any other relevant materials.</p>
    <p>The Captain may make recommendations regarding the disposition of any allegations and the amount of discipline, if any, to be imposed.</p>
    <p>Prior to forwarding recommendations to the Chief of Police, the Captain may return the entire investigation to the assigned investigator or supervisor for further investigation or action.</p>
    <p>When forwarding any written recommendation to the Chief of Police, the Captain shall include all relevant materials supporting the recommendation. Actual copies of a member's existing personnel file need not be provided and may be incorporated by
        reference.</p>
    <h4>1020.10.2 CHIEF OF POLICE RESPONSIBILITIES</h4>
    <p>Upon receipt of any written recommendation for disciplinary action, the Chief of Police shall review the recommendation and all accompanying materials. The Chief of Police may modify any recommendation and/or may return the file to the Captain for
        further investigation or action.</p>
    <p>Once the Chief of Police is satisfied that no further investigation or action is required by staff, the Chief of Police shall determine the amount of discipline, if any, that should be imposed. In the event disciplinary action is proposed, the Chief
        of Police shall provide the member with a written notice and the following:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Access to all of the materials considered by the Chief of Police in recommending the proposed discipline.</li>
        <li>An opportunity to respond orally or in writing to the Chief of Police within five days of receiving the notice.
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>Upon a showing of good cause by the member, the Chief of Police may grant a reasonable extension of time for the member to respond.</li>
                <li>If the member elects to respond orally, the presentation shall be recorded by the Department. Upon request, the member shall be provided with a copy of the recording.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Once the member has completed his/her response or if the member has elected to waive any such response, the Chief of Police shall consider all information received in regard to the recommended discipline. The Chief of Police shall render a timely
        written decision to the member and specify the grounds and reasons for discipline and the effective date of the discipline. Once the Chief of Police has issued a written decision, the discipline shall become effective.</p>
    <h4>1020.10.3 MINNESOTA POST INVESTIGATIONS</h4>
    <p>The Minnesota POST Board may require an administrative investigation based upon a complaint alleging a violation of a statute or rule that the board is empowered to enforce. Any such misconduct allegation or complaint assigned to this department shall
        be completed and a written summary submitted to the POST executive director within 30 days of the order for inquiry (Minn. Stat. § 214.10, Subd. 10).</p>
    <h4>1020.10.4 POST-ADMINISTRATIVE INVESTIGATION PROCEDURES Disciplinary action may include, but is not limited to (Minn. R. 6700.2200):</h4>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Oral reprimand.</li>
        <li>Written reprimand.</li>
        <li>Suspension.</li>
        <li>Demotion.</li>
        <li>Discharge.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>1020.11 PRE-DISCIPLINE EMPLOYEE RESPONSE</h3>
    <p>The pre-discipline process is intended to provide the accused employee with an opportunity to present a written or oral response to the Chief of Police after having had an opportunity to review the supporting materials and prior to imposition of any
        recommended discipline. The employee shall consider the following:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>The response is not intended to be an adversarial or formal hearing.</li>
        <li>Although the employee may be represented by an uninvolved representative or legal counsel, the response is not designed to accommodate the presentation of testimony or witnesses.</li>
        <li>The employee may suggest that further investigation could be conducted or the employee may offer any additional information or mitigating factors for the Chief of Police to consider.</li>
        <li>In the event that the Chief of Police elects to cause further investigation to be conducted, the employee shall be provided with the results prior to the imposition of any discipline.</li>
        <li>The employee may thereafter have the opportunity to further respond orally or in writing to the Chief of Police on the limited issues of information raised in any subsequent materials.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>1020.12 RESIGNATIONS/RETIREMENTS PRIOR TO DISCIPLINE</h3>
    <p>In the event that a member tenders a written resignation or notice of retirement prior to the imposition of discipline, it shall be noted in the file. The tender of a resignation or retirement by itself shall not serve as grounds for the termination
        of any pending investigation or discipline.</p>

    <h3>1020.13 PROBATIONARY EMPLOYEES AND OTHER MEMBERS</h3>
    <p>At-will and probationary employees and members other than non-probationary employees may be disciplined and/or released from employment without adherence to any of the procedures set out in this policy, and without notice or cause at any time. These
        individuals are not entitled to any rights under this policy except for employees covered by the Veterans Preference Act (Minn. Stat. § 197.46). However, any of these individuals released for misconduct should be afforded an opportunity solely
        to clear their names through a liberty interest hearing, which shall be limited to a single appearance before the Chief of Police or the authorized designee (Minn. R. 6700.2200).</p>
    <p>Any probationary period may be extended at the discretion of the Chief of Police in cases where the individual has been absent for more than a week or when additional time to review the individual is considered to be appropriate.</p>

    <h3>1020.14 SORTING EMPLOYEE COMPLAINTS</h3>

        or authorized personnel, except pursuant to lawful process, such as Minn. R. 6700.2500. Data in closed files shall be treated as private or public data depending on whether discipline was imposed upon the employee.</p>
    <h4>1020.15.2 LETTERS OF DISCIPLINE AND REPRIMANDS</h4>
    <p>Letters of discipline and reprimands may only be placed in an employee’s personnel file after they are received by the employee (see generally Minn. Stat. § 626.89, Subd. 13).</p>

            <div class="chapter" id="1022">
    <h2>1022 - Seat Belts</h2>
    <h3>1022.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>This policy establishes guidelines for the use of seat belts and child restraints. This policy will apply to all members operating or riding in department vehicles (Minn. Stat. § 169.686).</p>
    <h4>1022.1.1 DEFINITIONS</h4>
    <p>Definitions related to this policy include:</p>
    <p><strong>Child restraint system</strong> - An infant or child passenger restraint system that meets Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standards (FMVSS) and Regulations set forth in 49 CFR 571.213 (Minn. Stat. § 169.685).</p>

    <h3>1022.2 WEARING OF SAFETY RESTRAINTS</h3>
    <p>All members shall wear properly adjusted safety restraints when operating or riding in a seat equipped with restraints, in any vehicle owned, leased or rented by this department while on- or off-duty, or in any privately owned vehicle while on-duty.
        The member driving such a vehicle shall ensure that all other occupants, including those who are not members of the Department, are properly restrained (Minn. Stat. § 169.686).</p>
    <p>Exceptions to the requirement to wear safety restraints may be made only in exceptional situations where, due to unusual circumstances, wearing a seat belt would endanger the department member or the public. Members must be prepared to justify any
        deviation from this requirement.</p>

    <h3>1022.3 TRANSPORTING SUSPECTS, PRISONERS OR ARRESTEES</h3>
    <p>Suspects, prisoners and arrestees should be in a seated position and secured in the rear seat of any department vehicle with a prisoner restraint system or, when a prisoner restraint system is not available, by seat belts provided by the vehicle manufacturer.
        The prisoner restraint system is not intended to be a substitute for handcuffs or other appendage restraints.</p>
    <p>Prisoners in leg restraints shall be transported in accordance with the Handcuffing and Restraints Policy.</p>

    <h3>1022.4 INOPERABLE SEAT BELTS</h3>
    <p>Department vehicles shall not be operated when the seat belt in the driver's position is inoperable. Persons shall not be transported in a seat in which the seat belt is inoperable.</p>
    <p>Department vehicle seat belts shall not be modified, removed, deactivated or altered in any way, except by the vehicle maintenance and repair staff, who shall do so only with the express authorization of the Chief of Police.</p>
    <p>Members who discover an inoperable restraint system shall report the defect to the appropriate supervisor. Prompt action will be taken to replace or repair the system.</p>

    <h3>1022.5 VEHICLES MANUFACTURED WITHOUT SEAT BELTS</h3>
    <p>Vehicles manufactured and certified for use without seat belts or other restraint systems are subject to the manufacturer’s operator requirements for safe use.</p>

    <h3>1022.6 POLICY</h3>
    <p>It is the policy of the Metro Transit Police Department that members use safety and child restraint systems to reduce the possibility of death or injury in a motor vehicle collision.</p>

    <h3>1022.7 TRANSPORTING CHILDREN</h3>
    <p>All children younger than 8 years of age and shorter than 4 feet 9 inches tall shall be restrained in a child passenger safety seat system (Minn. Stat. § 169.685, Subd. 5(b)).</p>
    <p>Rear seat passengers in a cage-equipped vehicle may have reduced clearance, which requires careful seating and positioning of seat belts. Due to this reduced clearance, and if permitted by law, children and any child restraint system may be secured
        in the front seat of such vehicles provided this positioning meets federal safety standards and the vehicle and child restraint system manufacturer’s design and use recommendations. In the event that a child is transported in the front seat of
        a vehicle, the seat should be pushed back as far as possible and the passenger- side airbag should be deactivated. If this is not possible, members should arrange alternate transportation when feasible.</p>

    <h3>1022.8 VEHICLE AIRBAGS</h3>
    <p>In all vehicles equipped with airbag restraint systems, the system will not be tampered with or deactivated, except when transporting children as written elsewhere in this policy. All equipment installed in vehicles equipped with airbags will be installed
        as per the vehicle manufacturer specifications to avoid the danger of interfering with the effective deployment of the airbag device.</p>
</div>
            <div class="chapter" id="1024">
    <h2>1024 - Body Armor</h2>
    <h3>1024.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this policy is to provide law enforcement officers with guidelines for the proper use of body armor.</p>

    <h3>1024.2 POLICY</h3>
    <p>It is the policy of the Metro Transit Police Department to maximize officer safety through the use of body armor in combination with prescribed safety procedures. While body armor provides a significant level of protection, it is not a substitute
        for the observance of officer safety procedures.</p>

    <h3>1024.3 ISSUANCE OF BODY ARMOR</h3>
    <p>The Chief's Administrative Assistant shall ensure that all officers have access to body armor when the officer begins service at the Metro Transit Police Department and that the body armor meets or exceeds the standards of the National Institute of
        Justice. Full time officers will be issued their body armor whereas part time officers shall refer to their current contract for body armor requirements/ reimbursement specifics.</p>
    <p>The Chief's Administrative Assistant shall establish a body armor replacement schedule and ensure that replacement body armor is issued pursuant to the schedule or whenever the body armor becomes worn or damaged to the point that its effectiveness
        or functionality has been compromised.</p>
    <h4>1024.3.1 USE OF SOFT BODY ARMOR</h4>
    <p>Generally, the use of body armor is required subject to the following:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Officers shall only wear agency-approved body armor.</li>
        <li>Officers shall wear body armor anytime they are in a situation where they could reasonably be expected to take enforcement action.</li>
        <li>Officers may be excused from wearing body armor when they are functioning primarily in an administrative or support capacity and could not reasonably be expected to take enforcement action.</li>
        <li>Body armor shall be worn when an officer is working in uniform or taking part in Department range training.</li>
        <li>An officer may be excused from wearing body armor when he/she is involved in undercover or plainclothes work that his/her supervisor determines could be compromised by wearing body armor, or when a supervisor determines that other circumstances
            make it inappropriate to mandate wearing body armor.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>1024.3.2 INSPECTIONS OF BODY ARMOR</h4>
    <p>Supervisors should ensure that body armor is worn and maintained in accordance with this policy through routine observation and periodic documented inspections. Officers should routinely conduct inspections of their body armor for fit, cleanliness
        and signs of damage, abuse and wear.</p>
    <h4>1024.3.3 CARE AND MAINTENANCE OF SOFT BODY ARMOR</h4>
    <p>Soft body armor should never be stored for any period of time in an area where environmental conditions (e.g., temperature, light, humidity) are not reasonably controlled (e.g., normal ambient room temperature/humidity conditions), such as in automobiles
        or automobile trunks.</p>
    <p>Soft body armor should be cared for and cleaned pursuant to the manufacturer's care instructions provided with the soft body armor. The instructions can be found on labels located on the external surface of each ballistic panel. The carrier should
        also have a label that contains care instructions. Failure to follow these instructions may damage the ballistic performance capabilities of the armor. If care instructions for the soft body armor cannot be located, contact the manufacturer to
        request care instructions.</p>
    <p>Soft body armor should not be exposed to any cleaning agents or methods not specifically recommended by the manufacturer, as noted on the armor panel label.</p>

    <h3>1024.4 ARMORER RESPONSIBILITIES</h3>
    <p>The Training Coordinator should:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Monitor technological advances in the body armor industry for any appropriate changes to Department approved body armor.</li>
        <li>Assess weapons and ammunition currently in use and the suitability of approved body armor to protect against those threats.</li>
        <li>Provide training that educates officers about the safety benefits of wearing body armor.</li>

        <li>The examining physician or therapist will provide the Department with a report indicating that the employee is either fit for duty or, if not, list any functional limitations that limit the employee's ability to perform job duties. If the employee
            places his/her condition at issue in any subsequent or related administrative action or grievance, the examining physician or therapist may be required to disclose any and all information that is relevant to such proceeding.</li>
        <li>To facilitate the examination of any employee, the Department will provide all appropriate documents and available information to assist in the evaluation and/or treatment.</li>
        <li>All reports and evaluations submitted by the treating physician or therapist shall be part of the employee’s private medical file.</li>
        <li>Any employee ordered to receive a fitness for duty examination shall comply with the terms of the order and cooperate fully with the examining physician or therapist regarding any clinical interview, tests administered or other procedures as directed.
            Any failure to comply with such an order and any failure to cooperate with the examining physician or therapist may be deemed insubordination and may subject the employee to discipline up to and including termination.</li>
        <li>Once an employee has been deemed fit for duty by the examining physician or therapist, the employee will be notified to resume his/her duties.</li>
        <li>If an employee is deemed unfit for duty by the Department, the employee may submit a report from the employee’s personal physician, psychiatrist, psychologist or other health care provider that will be taken into consideration.</li>

    </ul>
    <p>The 24-hour and/or 168-hour period begins at the first hour worked and is a rolling time period.</p>
    <p>A supervisor, next level or above to the employee, shall authorize the exception to these guidelines. This authorization shall be in advance of the hours worked whenever possible. The supervisor should give consideration to reasonable rest periods
        and are authorized to deny overtime or relieve to off-duty status any member who has exceeded the above guidelines. The employee, who exceeds these guidelines, shall note the reason and supervisor that approved the exception when adding the hours
        worked into the payroll record management system.</p>

    <h2>1034 - Meal Periods and Breaks</h2>
    <h3>1034.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>This policy regarding meals and breaks, insofar as reasonably possible shall conform to the policy governing all Metropolitan Council / Metro Transit employees pursuant to Minn. Stat. § 177.253, Minn. Stat. § 177.254 and Minn. R. § 5200.0120.</p>
    <h4>1034.1.1 MEAL PERIODS</h4>
    <p>Each employee who works for eight or more consecutive hours is entitled to sufficient time to eat a meal (Minn. Stat. § 177.254).</p>
    <p>Licensed employees and dispatchers shall remain on-duty subject to call during meal periods. All other employees are not on call during meal periods unless directed otherwise by a supervisor.</p>
    <p>Uniformed officers shall request clearance from Transit Control Center prior to taking a meal period. Uniformed officers shall take their meal periods within their assigned areas unless on assignment outside of the Metropolitan Transit Police Department
        jurisdiction.
    </p>
    <p>The time spent for the meal period shall not exceed the authorized time allowed.</p>

    <h2>1035 - Lactation Break Policy</h2>
    <h3>1035.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>The purpose of this policy is to provide reasonable accommodations to employees desiring to express breast milk for the employee’s infant child.</p>

    <h3>1035.2 POLICY</h3>
    <p>It is the policy of this department to provide, in compliance with the Fair Labor Standards Act and Minnesota law, reasonable break time and appropriate facilities to accommodate any employee desiring to express breast milk for her nursing child,
        pursuant to Minn. Stat. § 181.939 and 29 USC § 207.</p>

    <h3>1035.3 LACTATION BREAK TIME</h3>
    <p>A rest period should be permitted each time the employee has the need to express breast milk (29 USC § 207). In general, lactation breaks that cumulatively total 30 minutes or less during any four- hour work period or major portion of a four-hour
        work period would be considered reasonable. However, individual circumstances may require more or less time.</p>
    <p>Lactation breaks, if feasible, should be taken at the same time as the employee’s regularly scheduled rest or meal periods. While a reasonable effort will be made to provide additional time beyond authorized breaks, any such time exceeding regularly
        scheduled and paid break time will be unpaid.</p>
    <p>Employees desiring to take a lactation break shall notify Transit Control Center or a supervisor prior to taking such a break. Such breaks may be reasonably delayed if they would seriously disrupt Department operations (Minn. Stat. § 181.939).</p>
    <p>Once a lactation break has been approved, the break should not be interrupted except for emergency or exigent circumstances.</p>

    <h3>1035.4 PRIVATE LOCATION</h3>
    <p>The Department will make reasonable efforts to accommodate employees with the use of an appropriate room or other location to express milk in private. Such room or place should be in close proximity to the employee’s work area and shall be other than
        a bathroom or toilet stall. The location must be shielded from view and free from intrusion from co-workers and the public. The location must have access to an electrical outlet (Minn. Stat. § 181.939; 29 USC § 207).</p>
    <p>The area assigned for this purpose should not be used for storage of any devices, supplies or expressed milk and should be returned to its original state after each use.</p>
    <p>Employees occupying such private areas shall either secure the door or otherwise make it clear to others that the area is occupied with a need for privacy. All other employees should avoid interrupting an employee during an authorized break, except
        to announce an emergency or other urgent circumstance.</p>
    <p>Authorized lactation breaks for employees assigned to the field may be taken at the nearest appropriate private area.</p>

    <h3>1035.5 STORAGE OF EXPRESSED MILK</h3>
    <p>Any employee storing expressed milk in any authorized refrigerated area within the Department shall clearly label it as such and shall remove it when the employee ends her shift.</p>

    <h2>1037 - Part-time Officer Work Schedules</h2>
    <h3>1037.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>The Metropolitan Transit Police Department employs part-time officers as part of its workforce to meet the service needs of the agency. The purpose of this policy is to establish a systematic and uniform procedure for maintaining a part-time officer's
        work schedule consistent with the needs of the Metropolitan Transit Police Department.</p>

    <h3>1037.2 SUBMITTING BIDS AND REQUIRED SERVICE</h3>
    <p>Work schedules are to be submitted on a bid sheet that will cover a two (2) week period. All schedule bids are to be returned to the Police Administrative office prior to the due date as listed on the bid sheet. All part-time sworn officer s must
        average a minimum of sixteen (16) hours each calendar month as evaluated on a quarterly basis.</p>
    <p>Part-time officers must work a minimum of two (2) Vikings and/or Gophers details each calendar year. Required detail hours worked shall count toward the 48 hour quarterly minimum.</p>
    <p>The work averages will be calculated during the following quarters:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Q1 = January, February and March</li>
        <li>Q2 = April, May and June</li>
        <li>Q3 = July, August and September</li>
        <li>Q4 = October, November and December</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>1037.2.1 ALLOWED VACATION</h4>
    <p>Officers will be allowed to designate a total of four (4) one-week periods throughout the year as vacation. Months in which one or more vacation weeks are taken will not be counted against the 16-hour per month average.</p>
    <p>Vacation periods must be designated in advance by making a written notice to the Patrol Captain a minimum of two weeks prior to the intended vacation.</p>

    <h3>1037.3 FAILURE TO MEET SERVICE REQUIREMENT</h3>
    <p>Officers who fail to meet minimum service requirements in any quarter will be notified of their deficiency. Officers will be required to submit a written response indicating how they will meet department service requirements and/or document mitigating
        circumstances. Absent any authorized mitigating circumstances, officers shall receive a written warning for failure to meet minimum service requirements for a first occurrence in any 12 month period. Failure to meet departmental service requirements
        (exclusive of authorized mitigating circumstances) for a second or subsequent quarter in any 12 month period will be grounds for separation from the Metropolitan Transit Police Department.</p>

    <h3>1037.4 OFFICER RESPONSIBILITIES AND OUTCOME</h3>
    <p>When an officer is scheduled for a shift, it shall be the officer's duty to work the shift bid or find another officer to fill that shift. An officer must report to the on-duty supervisor (Lieutenant if working or Sergeant if a Lieutenant is unavailable)
        any scheduling change.</p>
    <p>Any of the following circumstances will result in the officer receiving a <strong>WRITTEN NOTICE</strong> of the occurrence.</p>
    <p>If the officer:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Fails to work a scheduled shift</li>
        <li>Fails to find a replacement officer to work in that officer's place within four (4) hours of his/ her scheduled shift</li>
        <li>Fails to notify the on-duty supervisor (as set forth above) that the officer cannot work</li>
        <li>Fails to work a complete shift</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Upon receiving that notice, the officer will be provided an opportunity to give a written response. Three (3) such occurrences within any six (6) month period will require a meeting with the Patrol Captain to provide a plan to meet the Department
        service requirements. Failure to do so and/or continued occurrences will be grounds for dismissal.</p>

    <h3>1037.5 APPEALS</h3>
    <p>Decisions of the Patrol Lieutenants/Sergeants relative to this policy, may be appealed to the Patrol Captain. Decisions of the Patrol Captain may be appealed to the Chief of Police, whose decision on the matter will be final.</p>

    <h2>1039 - Part-time Officer Discipline Notifications</h2>
    <h3>1039.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>The Metro Transit Police Department employs part-time officers as a supplement to their full- time police force. Most of those officers work full-time for other law enforcement agencies. The professionalism, integrity and public image of the Metro
        Transit Police Department is determined by the conduct and discipline of each employee. The purpose of this policy is to ensure that all part-time officers make prompt notifications to the Metro Transit Police Department Administration regarding
        their employment status with their full-time employer.</p>
    <h3>1039.2 POLICY</h3>
    <p>At anytime during employment with the Metro Transit Police Department, it will be the responsibility of each part-time officer to notify the Metro Transit Chief of Police if the officer is placed on Administrative Leave, Suspended or Terminated from
        their home agency. Notifications to the Chief of Police shall be in writing and will state the reasons and the periods of such Administrative Leave, Suspension or Termination.</p>
    <p>Failure to notify the Metro Transit Chief of Police of any of the above changes in status, shall be grounds for Termination from the Metro Transit Police Department. Based upon the conditions and/or reasons for the officer's change in status (i.e.
        Administrative Leave, Suspension or Termination) from their home agency, it will be the decision of the Metro Transit Chief of Police if the officer will be allowed to work in any capacity for the Metro Transit Police during such periods of Administrative
        Leave, Suspension or Termination.</p>

    <h2>1040 - Outside Employment</h2>
    <h3>1040.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>To avoid actual or perceived conflicts of interest for Department employees engaging in outside employment, full-time employees shall initially obtain written approval from the Chief of Police prior to engaging in any outside employment. Approval
        of outside employment shall be at the discretion of the Chief of Police in accordance with the provisions of this policy.</p>
    <h4>1040.1.1 DEFINITIONS</h4>
    <p><strong>Outside Employment</strong> - The employment of any member of this department who receives wages, compensation or other consideration of value from another employer, organization or individual not affiliated directly with this department for
        services, product(s) or benefits rendered. For purposes of this section, the definition of outside employment includes those employees who are self- employed and not affiliated directly with this department for services, product(s) or benefits
        rendered.
    </p>
    <p><strong>Outside Overtime</strong> - Overtime involving any member of this department who performs duties or services on behalf of an outside organization, company or individual within this jurisdiction on behalf of the Department. Such outside overtime
        shall be requested and scheduled directly through this department so that the Department may be reimbursed for the cost of wages and benefits.</p>

    <h3>1040.2 OBTAINING APPROVAL</h3>
    <p>No full-time members of this department may engage in any outside employment without first obtaining prior written approval of the Chief of Police. Failure to obtain prior written approval for outside employment or engaging in outside employment prohibited
        by this policy is grounds for disciplinary action.</p>
    <p>To obtain approval for outside employment, the employee must submit a letter requesting approval to work outside of the Department. The letter shall be submitted to the employee's immediate supervisor. The letter will then be forwarded through the
        appropriate chain of command to the Chief of Police for consideration.</p>
    <p>If approved, the employee will be provided with a copy of the approved letter. Unless otherwise indicated in writing on the letter of approval, the ability to work outside employment will be valid through the end of the calendar year in which it is
        approved. Any employee seeking to continue outside employment shall submit a new letter in a timely manner.</p>
    <p>Any employee seeking approval of outside employment whose request has been denied shall be provided with a written reason for the denial of the request at the time of the denial and within 30 days of the request.</p>
    <h4>1040.2.1 APPEAL OF DENIAL OF OUTSIDE EMPLOYMENT</h3>
    <p>If an employee's outside employment request is denied or rescinded by the Department, the employee may file a written notice of appeal to the Chief of Police within 10 days of the date of denial.</p>
    <p>If the employee's appeal is denied, the employee may file a grievance pursuant to the procedure set forth in the current collective bargaining agreement.</p>
    <h4>1040.2.2 REVOCATION/SUSPENSION OF OUTSIDE EMPLOYMENT PERMITS</h4>
    <p>Any outside employment approval may be revoked or suspended after the employee has received written notification of the reasons for revocation or suspension. Revocation will be implemented after the employee has exhausted the appeal process.</p>
    <p>The outside employment may be revoked:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>If an employee's performance declines to a point where it is evaluated by a supervisor as needing improvement to reach an overall level of minimum acceptable competency and the outside employment may be related to the employee's performance. The
            Chief of Police may, at his/her discretion, notify the employee of the intent to revoke any previously approved outside employment request(s). After the appeal process has concluded, the revocation will remain in force until the employee's
            performance directly related to the outside employment has been reestablished to the minimum level of acceptable competency.</li>
        <li>If, at any time during the term of a valid outside employment approval, an employee's conduct or outside employment conflicts with the provisions of Department policy or any law.</li>
        <li>The outside employment creates an actual or apparent conflict of interest with the Department or Metropolitan Council / Metro Transit.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>1040.3 PROHIBITED OUTSIDE EMPLOYMENT</h3>
    <p>The Department expressly reserves the right to deny any outside employment request submitted by an employee seeking to engage in any activity that:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Involves the employee to engage in any business or occupation which is not compatible with police work (e.g. bartending, repossession work, any establishment that provides adult entertainment in the form of nude, semi-nude or topless exhibition,
            on-sale liquor establishments whose primary source of income is selling or dispensing of alcohol).</li>
        <li>Involves the employee's use of Department time, facilities, equipment or supplies, the use of the Department badge, uniform, prestige or influence for private gain or advantage.</li>
        <li>Involves the employee's receipt or acceptance of any money or other consideration from anyone other than this department for the performance of an act that the employee, if not performing such act, would be required or expected to render in the
            regular course or hours of employment or as a part of the employee's duties as a member of this department.</li>
        <li>Involves the performance of an act in other than the employee's capacity as a member of this department that may later be subject directly or indirectly to the control, inspection, review, audit or enforcement of any other employee of this department.</li>
        <li>Involves time demands that would render performance of the employee's duties for this department below minimum standards or would render the employee unavailable for reasonably anticipated overtime assignments and other job-related demands that
            occur outside regular working hours.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>1040.3.1 OUTSIDE SECURITY EMPLOYMENT</h4>
    <p>Due to the potential conflict of interest no member of this department may engage in any outside or secondary employment as a private security guard, private investigator or other similar private security position.</p>
    <p>Any private organization, entity or individual seeking special services for security or traffic control from members of this department must submit a written request to the Chief of Police in advance of the desired service. Such outside overtime will
        be monitored by the patrol supervisor.</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>The applicant will be required to enter into a written indemnification agreement prior to approval.</li>
        <li>The applicant will further be required to provide for the compensation and full benefits of all employees requested for such outside security services.</li>
        <li>If such a request is approved, any employee working outside overtime shall be subject to the following conditions:
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>The officer(s) shall wear the Department uniform/identification.</li>
                <li>The officer(s) shall be subject to all the rules and regulations of this department.</li>
                <li>No officer may engage in such outside employment during or at the site of a strike, lockout, picket or other physical demonstration of a labor dispute.</li>

            </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <h4>1040.3.2 OUTSIDE OVERTIME ARREST AND REPORTING PROCEDURE</h4>
    <p>Any employee making an arrest or taking other official law enforcement action while working in an approved outside overtime assignment shall be required to complete all related reports in a timely manner pursuant to Department policy. Time spent on
        the completion of such reports shall be considered incidental to the outside overtime assignment.</p>
    <h4>1040.3.3 SPECIAL RESTRICTIONS</h4>
    <p>Except for emergency situations or with prior authorization from the Captain, undercover officers or officers assigned to covert operations shall not be eligible to work overtime or other assignments in a uniformed or other capacity that might reasonably
        disclose the officer's law enforcement status.</p>

    <h3>1040.4 DEPARTMENT RESOURCES</h3>
    <p>Employees are prohibited from using any Department equipment or resources in the course of or for the benefit of any outside employment. This shall include the prohibition of access to official records or databases of this department or other agencies
        through the use of the employee's position with this department.</p>

    <h3>1040.5 CHANGES IN OUTSIDE EMPLOYMENT STATUS</h3>
    <p>If an employee terminates his/her outside employment during the valid approval period, the employee shall promptly submit written notification of such termination to the Chief of Police through the appropriate chain of command. Any subsequent request
        for renewal or continued outside employment must thereafter be processed and approved through normal procedures set forth in this policy.</p>
    <p>Employees shall also promptly submit in writing to the Chief of Police any material changes in outside employment including any change in the number of hours, type of duties or demands of any approved outside employment. Employees who are uncertain
        whether a change in outside employment is material shall report the change.</p>

    <h3>1040.6 OUTSIDE EMPLOYMENT WHILE ON DISABILITY OR ADMINISTRATIVE LEAVE</h3>
    <P>Department members engaged in outside employment who are placed on disability or administrative leave or modified/light-duty shall inform the Chief of Police in writing within five days whether they intend to continue to engage in outside employment
        while on such leave or light- duty status. The Chief of Police shall review the duties of the outside employment along with any work-related doctor's orders and make a determination whether such outside employment should continue or be suspended
        or revoked.</span>
    </p>
    <p>In the event the Chief of Police determines that the outside employment should be discontinued or if the employee fails to promptly notify the Chief of Police of his/her intentions regarding the outside employment, a notice of intent to revoke the
        employee's outside employment approval will be forwarded to the involved employee and a copy attached to the original approved request. The revocation process outlined in this policy shall be followed.</p>
    <p>Criteria for revoking or suspending the outside employment request while on disability status or administrative leave include, but are not limited to, the following:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>The outside employment is medically detrimental to the total recovery of the disabled employee, as indicated by the Metropolitan Council / Metro Transit's professional medical advisors.</li>
        <li>The outside employment performed requires the same or similar physical ability, as would be required of an on-duty employee.</li>
        <li>The employee's failure to make timely notice of his/her intentions to the Chief of Police.</li>
        <li>The outside employment is not compatible with the reason the employee is on administrative leave.</li>

    <p>Supervisors shall determine whether the Major Incident Notification and Workplace Accident and Injury Reduction policies apply and take additional action as required.</p>
    <h4>1042.3.3 CAPTAIN RESPONSIBILITIES</h4>
    <p>The Captain who receives a report of an occupational disease, personal injury or death should review the report for accuracy and determine what additional action should be taken. The report shall then be forwarded to the Chief of Police and the Metropolitan

        be forwarded to the appropriate Captain through the chain of command and a copy sent to the Administration.</p>
    <p>Unless the injury is extremely minor, this report shall be signed by the affected member, indicating that he/she desired no medical attention at the time of the report. By signing, the member does not preclude his/her ability to later seek medical
        attention.</p>

    <h3>1042.5 SETTLEMENT OFFERS</h3>

        terms of such settlement. In no case shall the member accept a settlement without first providing written notice to the Chief of Police. The</p>
    <p>purpose of such notice is to permit the Metropolitan Council / Metro Transit to determine whether the offered settlement will affect any claim the Metropolitan Council / Metro Transit may have regarding payment for damage to equipment or reimbursement
        for wages against the person who caused the disease or injury, and to protect the Metropolitan Council / Metro Transit's right of subrogation, while ensuring that the member's right to receive compensation is not affected.</p>

    <p>The Metro Transit Police Department understands the value that CSO’s provide to the agency and believes in affording CSO's the opportunity to participate in a competitive selection process to become a police officer. Therefore, upon completion of
        a Law Enforcement or related program, CSO's will be allowed two attempts (consecutive job postings) to gain employment as police officers with the Metro Transit Police Department. Following the two attempts, and only if granted by the Chief of
        Police, CSO’s will have no more than a 90 day extension prior to termination of employment as a CSO.</p>

    <h2>1054 - Temporary Modified-Duty Assignments</h2>
    <h3>1054.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>This policy establishes procedures for providing temporary modified-duty assignments. This policy is not intended to affect the rights or benefits of employees under federal or state law, Metropolitan Council / Metro Transit rules, or current memorandums
        of understanding or collective bargaining agreements. For example, nothing in this policy affects the obligation of the Department to engage in a good faith, interactive process to consider reasonable accommodations for any employee with a temporary
        or permanent disability that is protected under federal or state law.</p>

    <h3>1054.2 POLICY</h3>
    <p>Subject to operational considerations, the Metro Transit Police Department may identify temporary modified-duty assignments for employees who have an injury or medical condition resulting in temporary work limitations or restrictions. A temporary
        assignment allows the employee to work, while providing the Department with a productive employee during the temporary period.</p>

    <h3>1054.3 GENERAL CONSIDERATIONS</h3>
    <p>Priority consideration for temporary modified-duty assignments will be given to employees with work-related injuries or illnesses that are temporary in nature. Employees having disabilities covered under the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) or
        the Minnesota Human Rights Act (Minn. Stat. § 363A.01 et seq.) shall be treated equally, without regard to any preference for a work-related injury.</p>
    <p>No position in the Metro Transit Police Department shall be created or maintained as a temporary modified-duty assignment.</p>
    <p>Temporary modified-duty assignments are a management prerogative and not an employee right. The availability of temporary modified-duty assignments will be determined on a case-by- case basis, consistent with the operational needs of the Department.
        Temporary modified-duty assignments are subject to continuous reassessment, with consideration given to operational needs and the employee's ability to perform in a modified-duty assignment.</p>
    <p>The Chief of Police or the authorized designee may restrict employees working in temporary modified-duty assignments from wearing a uniform, displaying a badge, carrying a firearm, operating an emergency vehicle, engaging in outside employment or
        being otherwise limited in employing their peace officer powers.</p>
    <p>Temporary modified-duty assignments shall generally not exceed a cumulative total of 1,040 hours in any one-year period.</p>

    <h3>1054.4 PROCEDURE</h3>
    <p>Employees may request a temporary modified-duty assignment for short-term injuries or illnesses.</p>
    <p>Employees seeking a temporary modified-duty assignment should submit a written request to their Captain or the authorized designees. The request should, as applicable, include a certification from the treating medical professional containing:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>An assessment of the nature and probable duration of the illness or injury.</li>
        <li>The prognosis for recovery.</li>
        <li>The nature and scope of limitations and/or work restrictions.</li>
        <li>A statement regarding any required workplace accommodations, mobility aids or medical devices.</li>
        <li>A statement that the employee can safely perform the duties of the temporary modified-duty assignment.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>The Captain will make a recommendation through the chain of command to the Chief of Police regarding temporary modified-duty assignments that may be available based on the needs of the Department and the limitations of the employee. The Chief of Police
        or the authorized designee shall confer with the Department of Human Resources or the General Counsel as appropriate.</p>
    <p>Requests for a temporary modified-duty assignment of 20 hours or less per week may be approved and facilitated by the Shift Supervisor or Captain, with notice to the Chief of Police.</p>

    <h3>1054.5 ACCOUNTABILITY</h3>
    <p>Written notification of assignments, work schedules and any restrictions should be provided to employees assigned to temporary modified-duty assignments and their supervisors. Those assignments and schedules may be adjusted to accommodate department
        operations and the employee's medical appointments, as mutually agreed upon with the Captain.</p>
    <h4>1054.5.1 EMPLOYEE RESPONSIBILITIES</h4>
    <p>The responsibilities of employees assigned to temporary modified duty shall include, but not be limited to:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Communicating and coordinating any required medical and physical therapy appointments in advance with their supervisors.</li>
        <li>Promptly notifying their supervisors of any change in restrictions or limitations after each appointment with their treating medical professionals.</li>
        <li>Communicating a status update to their supervisors no less than once every 30 days while assigned to temporary modified duty.</li>
        <li>Submitting a written status report to the Captain that contains a status update and anticipated date of return to full-duty when a temporary modified-duty assignment extends beyond 60 days.</li>
    </ol>
    <h4>1054.5.2 SUPERVISOR RESPONSIBILITIES</h4>
    <p>The employee's immediate supervisor shall monitor and manage the work schedule of those assigned to temporary modified duty.</p>
    <p>The responsibilities of supervisors shall include, but not be limited to:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Periodically apprising the Captain of the status and performance of employees assigned to temporary modified duty.</li>
        <li>Notifying the Captain and ensuring that the required documentation facilitating a return to full duty is received from the employee.</li>
        <li>Ensuring that employees returning to full duty have completed any required training and certification.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>1054.6 MEDICAL EXAMINATIONS</h3>
    <p>Prior to returning to full-duty status, employees shall be required to provide certification from their treating medical professionals stating that they are medically cleared to perform the essential functions of their jobs without restrictions or
        limitations.</p>
    <p>The Department may require a fitness-for-duty examination prior to returning an employee to full- duty status, in accordance with the Fitness for Duty Policy.</p>

    <h3>1054.7 PREGNANCY</h3>
    <p>If an employee is temporarily unable to perform regular duties due to a pregnancy, childbirth or a related medical condition, the employee will be treated the same as any other temporarily disabled employee (42 USC § 2000e(k)). A pregnant employee
        shall not be involuntarily transferred to a temporary modified-duty assignment.</p>
    <h4>1054.7.1 NOTIFICATION</h4>
    <p>Pregnant employees should notify their immediate supervisors as soon as practicable and provide a statement from their medical providers identifying any pregnancy-related job restrictions or limitations. If at any point during the pregnancy it becomes
        necessary for the employee to take a leave of absence, such leave shall be granted in accordance with the Metropolitan Council / Metro Transit personnel rules and regulations regarding family and medical care leave.</p>

    <h3>1054.8 PROBATIONARY EMPLOYEES</h3>
    <p>Probationary employees who are assigned to a temporary modified-duty assignment shall have their probation extended by a period of time equal to their assignment to temporary modified duty.</p>

    <h3>1054.9 MAINTENANCE OF CERTIFICATION AND TRAINING</h3>
    <p>Employees assigned to temporary modified duty shall maintain all certification, training and qualifications appropriate to both their regular and temporary duties, provided that the certification(s), training or qualifications are not in conflict
        with any medical limitations or restrictions. Employees who are assigned to temporary modified duty shall inform their supervisors of any inability to maintain any certification(s), training or qualifications.</p>

            <div class="chapter" id="1058">
    <h2>1058 - Emplyee Speeach, Expression and Social Networking</h2>
    <h3>1058.1 PURPOSE AND SCOPE</h3>
    <p>This policy is intended to address issues associated with employee use of social networking sites and to provide guidelines for the regulation and balance of employee speech and expression with the needs of the Department.</p>
    <p>Nothing in this policy is intended to prohibit or infringe upon any communication, speech or expression that is protected or privileged under law. This includes speech and expression protected under state or federal constitutions as well as labor
        or other applicable laws. For example this policy does not limit an employee from speaking as a private citizen, including acting as an authorized member of a recognized bargaining unit or officer associations, about matters of public concern
        such as misconduct or corruption.</p>
    <p>Employees are encouraged to consult with their supervisor regarding any questions arising from the application or potential application of this policy.</p>
    <h4>1058.1.1 APPLICABILITY</h4>
    <p>This policy applies to all forms of communication including but not limited to film, video, print media, public or private speech, use of all Internet services, including the World Wide Web, e- mail, file transfer, remote computer access, news services,
        social networking, social media, instant messaging, blogs, forums, wikis, video and other file sharing sites.</p>

    <h3>1058.2 POLICY</h3>
    <p>Because public employees occupy a trusted position in the community their statements have the potential to contravene the policies and performance of this department. Due to the nature of the work and influence associated with the law enforcement
        profession it is necessary that employees of this department be subject to certain reasonable limitations on their speech and expression. To achieve its mission and efficiently provide service to the public the Metro Transit Police Department
        will carefully balance the individual employee's rights against the organization's needs and interests when exercising a reasonable degree of control over its employees' speech and expression.</p>

    <h3>1058.3 SAFETY</h3>
    <p>Employees should carefully consider the implications of their speech or any other form of expression when using the Internet. Speech and expression that may negatively affect the safety of Metro Transit Police Department employees such as posting
        personal information in a public forum can result in compromising an employee's home address or family ties. Employees should therefore not disseminate or post any information on any forum or medium that could reasonably be expected to compromise
        the safety of any employee, employee's family or associates or persons that this agency has had professional contact with such as crime victims or staff of other organizations. Examples of the type of information that could reasonably be expected
        to compromise safety include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Disclosing a photograph and name or address of an employee.</li>
        <li>Disclosing the address, telephone number or email address of an employee.</li>
        <li>Otherwise disclosing where another employee can be located off-duty.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>1058.4 PROHIBITED SPEECH, EXPRESSION AND CONDUCT</h3>
    <p>To meet the organization's safety, performance and public-trust needs the following are prohibited unless the speech is otherwise protected (for example an employee speaking as a private citizen, including acting as an authorized member of a recognized
        bargaining unit or officer associations, on a matter of public concern):</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Speech or expression made pursuant to an official duty that tends to compromise or damage the mission, function, reputation or professionalism of the Metro Transit Police Department or its employees.</li>
        <li>Speech or expression that, while not made pursuant to an official duty, is significantly linked to or related to the Metro Transit Police Department and tends to compromise or damage the mission, function, reputation or professionalism of the
            Metro Transit Police Department or its employees. Examples may include:
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>Statements that indicate disregard for the law or the state or U.S. Constitution.</li>
                <li>Expression that demonstrates support for criminal activity.</li>
                <li>Participating in sexually explicit photographs or videos for compensation or distribution.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Speech or expression that could reasonably be foreseen as having a negative impact on the credibility of the employee as a witness. For example posting statements or expressions to a website that glorify or endorse dishonesty or illegal behavior.</li>
        <li>Speech or expression of any form that could reasonably be foreseen as having a negative impact on the safety of the employees of the Department. For example a statement on a blog that provides specific details as to how and when prisoner transportations
            are made could reasonably be foreseen to jeopardize employees by informing criminals of details that could facilitate an escape or attempted escape.</li>
        <li>Speech or expression that is contrary to the canons of the Law Enforcement Code of Ethics as adopted by the Metro Transit Police Department.</li>
        <li>Use or disclosure, through whatever means, of any not public data, photograph, video or other recording obtained or accessible as a result of employment with the Department for financial or personal gain or data classified as not public by state
            or federal law or any disclosure of such materials without the express authorization of the Chief of Police or the authorized designee.</li>
        <li>Posting, transmitting or disseminating any photographs, video or audio recordings, likenesses or images of department logos, emblems, uniforms, badges, patches, marked vehicles, equipment or other material that specifically identifies the Metro
            Transit Police Department on any personal or social networking or other website or web page without the express authorization of the Chief of Police.</li>
        <li>Accessing websites for non-authorized purposes or use of any personal communication device, game device or media device, whether personally or department-owned, for personal purposes while on-duty except in the following circumstances:</p>
            <ol class="decimal">
                <li>When brief personal communications may be warranted by the circumstances (e.g., inform family of extended hours).</li>
                <li>During authorized breaks; such usage should be limited as much as practicable to areas out of sight and sound of the public and shall not be disruptive to the work environment.</li>
            </ol>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>Employees must take reasonable and prompt action to remove any content, including content posted by others, that is in violation of this policy from any web page or website maintained by the employee (e.g., social or personal website).</p>
    <h4>1058.4.1 UNAUTHORIZED ENDORSEMENTS AND ADVERTISEMENTS</h4>
    <p>While employees are not restricted from engaging in the following activities as private citizens or as authorized members of a recognized bargaining unit or officer associations, employees may not represent the Metro Transit Police Department or identify
        themselves in any way that could be reasonably perceived as representing the Metro Transit Police Department in order to do any of the following, unless specifically authorized by the Chief of Police:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Endorse, support, oppose or contradict any political campaign or initiative.</li>
        <li>Endorse, support, oppose or contradict any social issue, cause or religion.</li>
        <li>Endorse, support, or oppose any product, service, company or other commercial entity.</li>
        <li>Appear in any commercial, social or nonprofit publication or any motion picture, film, video, public broadcast or any website.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>Additionally, when it can reasonably be construed that an employee acting in his/her individual capacity or through an outside group or organization (e.g. bargaining group) is affiliated with this department, the employee shall give a specific disclaiming
        statement that any such speech or expression is not representative of the Metro Transit Police Department.</p>
    <p>Employees retain their right to vote as they choose, to support candidates of their choice and to express their opinions as private citizens, including as authorized members of a recognized bargaining unit or officer associations, on political subjects
        and candidates at all times while off- duty. However employees may not use their official authority or influence to interfere with or affect the result of an election or a nomination for office. Employees are also prohibited from directly or indirectly
        using their official authority to coerce, command or advise another employee to pay, lend or contribute anything of value to a party, committee, organization, agency or person for political purposes (5 USC § 1502).</p>

    <h3>1058.5 PRIVACY EXPECTATION</h3>
    <p>Members forfeit any expectation of privacy with regard to e-mails, texts, or anything published or maintained through file-sharing software or any Internet site (e.g., Facebook, MySpace) that is accessed, transmitted, received or reviewed on any department
        technology system (see the Information Technology Use Policy for additional guidance).</p>

    <h3>1058.6 CONSIDERATIONS</h3>
    <p>In determining whether to grant authorization of any speech or conduct that is prohibited under this policy, the factors that the Chief of Police or authorized designee should consider include:</p>
    <ol class="alpha">
        <li>Whether the speech or conduct would negatively affect the efficiency of delivering public services.</li>
        <li>Whether the speech or conduct would be contrary to the good order of the Department or the efficiency or morale of its members.</li>
        <li>Whether the speech or conduct would reflect unfavorably upon the Department.</li>
        <li>Whether the speech or conduct would negatively affect the member's appearance of impartiality in the performance of his/her duties.</li>
        <li>Whether similar speech or conduct has been previously authorized.</li>
        <li>Whether the speech or conduct may be protected and outweighs any interest of the Department.</li>
    </ol>

    <h3>1058.7 TRAINING</h3>
    <p>Subject to available resources the Department should provide training regarding employee speech and the use of social networking to all members of the Department.</p>
